<h3>The Seventy Weeks Prophecy by Daniel the Prophet</h3>

<br>

One of the most fascinating, exact, and misunderstood prophecies in the bible is Daniel 9:20, the prophecy of seventy weeks.
<br>
This was given to Daniel in prayer by Angel Gabriel.

<h3>Daniel 9:24</h3>
<pre>
Seventy weeks are determined
For your people and for your holy city,
To finish the transgression,
To make an end of sins,
To make reconciliation for iniquity,
To bring in everlasting righteousness,
To seal up vision and prophecy,
And to anoint the Most Holy.
</pre>

Recall that Solomons temple, the first temple, was destroyed during the seige of Jerusalem in 587 BC by Nebuchanezzar, as the Babylonians took the city.  Since Daniel was born approx 620BC, this makes him about 30 years old when Jerusalem was taken.
Daniel was taken into Babylonian captivity by Nebuchanezzar in 605 bc.  Remember this captivity is going to be for 70 years.
<br>
<br>
Daniel will prophesy that a new temple will be built (Herods temple, at the end of
captivity, authorized by Cyrus), a certain number of years will pass, our Messiah Jesus will be born and be cut off (crucified),
the city will be destroyed (Rome) along with the second temple, the Jews will be scattered, the church age will commence,
the fullness of the Gentiles will be fulfilled (at the 70th week), and the order will be made to build the 3rd temple,
the abomination of desolation will occur, the Antichrist will be defeated, and Jesus will rule in the Millenial
Kingdom for 1000 years.

<br>

<h3>Daniel 9:25</h3>
<pre>
“Know therefore and understand,
That from the going forth of the command
To restore and build Jerusalem
Until Messiah the Prince,
There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks;
The street shall be built again, and the wall,
Even in troublesome times.
</pre>

<br>

Let us explain carefully that the Jews were in captivity in Babylon from 605 BC all the way to 538 BC (70 years) before the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus%27s_edict>Decree of Cyrus </a>
was announced allowing the Jews to go back to Jerusalem.  
<br>
<br>
From this date, 538 BC through 515 BC, over 50,000 Jews returned to Jerusalem, but there was still no wall or street.  At this point in 516 BC,
they had rebuilt the sacrificial altar.  Zerubbabel and Cyrus had authorized the rebuilding of Herods temple, and the temple was just completed in 516BC.  (This is the original modest version of the
second temple, before Herod remodeled it).  
<br>
<br>
Then a second wave of Jews returned led by Ezra up to 458BC.  The city walls were not yet rebuilt!  Under Nehemiah, in 445 BC, the city walls were built again.

<br>

This is a strong, and fascinating, and exact start date for Daniel 9:25 (notice it says the wall), and the wall was built in 445 BC.
<br>
<br>

There will be 62 weeks, 7 weeks, and 1 week (a total of 70 weeks of years, for the entire prophecy).
<br>
Let us break down each set of weeks that will occur, and the corresponding events.
<br>


From 445 BC to 34 AD we have a time span of 69 weeks, or 173,880 days (from the going forth to rebuild the walls of the city to the date the Messiah is cut off).
<br>


Side note: We know 34AD is a strong date for the Crucifixion because that event occurred the day after passover in a year relevant to a jubilee, and King Herod had coins in those years corresponding to Jesus ministry period.
<br>
<br>
"There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks" ... between [the order to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem] until Messiah the Prince.
Sixty Nine weeks equals 173,880 days.  The duration between 445BC to 34 AD is exactly 173,880.  This means the Messiah was crucified on the last day of the first 69 weeks of Daniels prophecy.
<br>

Summary:  We do recognize 69 weeks of solar days between the command to rebuild the street of Jerusalem after Babylonian captivity and the date the Messiah was crucified.  That fulfills Daniel 9:25.

<br>
<br>

<br>


<h3>Interpreting Daniel 9:26</h3>
<pre>
And after the sixty-two weeks
Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself;
And the people of the prince who is to come
Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.
The end of it shall be with a flood,
And till the end of the war desolations are determined.
</pre>
<br>

This means that we should measure 62 weeks (434 years) between a [certain start date in Jerusalem] and Jesus crucifixion date.
<br>
Knowing that Jesus was crucified in 34 AD, we look at significant events in Jerusalem around 400 BC, and we find the Great Assembly occurred (this is similar to formation of the modern day San Hedrin, but
more accurately an assembly of prophets in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Assembly>Synagogue.</a>
<br>

If we use the dates of 400BC (After establishment of the Great Assembly of the Prophets) and 34 AD we arrive at 434 years.
<br>
<br> Additionally, we know that after Jesus was crucified, in 34AD, approximately 36 years passed and then Rome was destroyed (including Herods temple).  
This fulfills "And the people of the prince who is to come (Rome) shall destroy the city and the sanctuary (the temple was utterly destroyed in 70AD)".
<br>

<br>Summary:  This fulfills Daniel 9:26, a span of 434 years between the reinstitution of the operation of the Temple of Herod, and the Crucifixion of Jesus (the Messiah will be cut off but not for himself).
<br>
<br>
Side note:  We know that "And til the end of the war desolations are determined" is a verse that is meant for the future tribulation (see the following on Daniel 9:27's interpretation), and we know the true meaning
of flood here from Daniel 11:22 (The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant) means that the future Gentile armies commanded by the Antichrist will flood in and destroy
the 3rd temple (the Antichrists temple).
<br>
<h3>Interpreting Daniel 9:27</h3>
<pre>
Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week;
But in the middle of the week
He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering.
And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate,
Even until the consummation, which is determined,
Is poured out on the desolate.”
</pre>
<br>
<br>
This is Daniels 70th (and final) week.
<br>

<br>We know that an indeterminate amount of time occurs between Daniel 9:26 and Daniel 9:27, because Daniel does not specify events that occur between the crucifixion and the covenant of Many.
<br>
<br>

The bible says men do not know the day or the hour of Jesus return.  Additionally, we know that the church age started after Jesus was crucified (Pentecost), and we believe this lasts approx. 2000 years.
So using this as a guide, we look for the Antichrist to appear approximately at the end of the church age (this is when the Jews announce rebuilding of the 3rd temple, and when the Antichrist appears on the scene).
This antichrist is going to declare a covenant with many (a peace treaty that promises peace between Israel and Palestine), and sacrifices will start again at the temple.
Daniel says that when this covenant with many is confirmed, Daniels 70th week starts!
<br>
<br>
This also is the beginning of the tribulation, a period of seven years!
<br>
<br>
In the middle of the week, sacrifices shall stop, and the Antichrist will cause the abomination of desolation, and then the Great Tribulation (the final 3.5 years) will occur.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Thank you for reading the summary of Daniels 70 weeks!

<br>
Remember, never, ever take the Mark of the Beast!
