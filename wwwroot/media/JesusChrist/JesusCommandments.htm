<h1>
   Jesus' Commandments by Samuel Mills

</h1>
<p>
<h2>
The Commandments of Jesus must not be confused with the “Ten Commandments” in the Old Testament.
</h2>

<p>
<h4>

Jesus said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments," (John 14:15, KJV).
<p>

As you study these commandments (orders) of Jesus it will become very clear that God is not only the God of Grace, He is also the God of expectations.
  You will also see that obeying the Commandments of Jesus will bring  rewards beyond measure.
<p>

	For example, “Ye must be born again” (Jn 3:7), is considered to be one of the Commandments of Jesus. Those who obey receive Eternal Life!
	<p>
	The Old Testament Commandments beautifully teach what God considers to be sin, but they require perfection, and no person has ever been perfect (good enough), so it can only bring condemnation.
	<p>
	However, Jesus, being the "Son of God" and therefore perfect, could and did live up to the requirements of the Old Testament Law, and by doing so was qualified to die in the place of all who would accept Him as their Savior.
	<p>
		There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Rom 8:1).  Jesus paid it all!
		<p>



<p>


"The Greatest Commandment"
<p>
	Jesus was asked: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" Jesus replied: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'
	This is the first and greatest commandment.
	And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments," (Matt 22:36-40, Amp).
<p>

"The Golden Rule"
<p>
"So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets," ((Matt 7:12 NIV).

<p>


Although these Commandments of Jesus are not in numerical order as are the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament, most Bible Scholars agree that they are most assuredly the Commandments of Jesus.



<ul>
The Commandments of Jesus From the Four Gospels

<li>
	1. "When you stand praying, forgive"
	<p>
	"And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him,
	so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." But if you <b>do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your sins." (Mark 11:25-26 NIV)</b>
<li>
2. "You must be born again"
<p>"You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again." (John 3:7 KJV)

<li>

3. "Remain in Me and I will remain in you"
<p>
When you ask Jesus into your heart and He becomes your Lord and Savior, the Holy Spirit actually lives in you, and you in Him. Here Jesus uses a grape vine to compare our relationship with Him. "Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me." ( John 15:4 NIV)
<li>
4. "Let your light shine before men"
<p>
"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. " In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven," (Matt 5:14;16 NIV).
<li>
5. "Settle matters quickly with your adversary"
<p>
"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison." (Matt 5:25 NIV)
<li>
6. "Get rid of whatever causes you to sin"
<p>
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." (Matt 5:29-30 NIV)
<li>
7. "Do Not Swear at All"
<p>
"But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one," (Matt 5:34-37 KJV).
<li>
8. "Do Not Resist an Evil Person"
<p>
(Turning the other cheek.)

"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also," (Matt 5:38-39 NIV).
<li>
9. "Giving More than is Demanded" (Going the extra mile)
<p>
"And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you," (Matt 5:40-42 NIV).
<li>
10. "Love Your Enemies"
<p>
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous," (Matt 5:43-45 NIV).
<li>
11. "Give to Please God, Not to be Seen"
<p>
"Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven," (Matt 6:1 NIV).
<li>
12. "Pray Privately, Not to be Seen of Men"
<p>
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words,"
(Matt 6:5-7 NIV).

<li>

13. "This, then, is how you should pray"
<p>
"This, then, is how you should pray: " 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'
<p>
For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins," (Matt 6:9-15 NIV).
<li>
14. "Fast Without Fanfare"
<p>
"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full," (Matt 6:16 NIV).
<li>
15. "Do not Store up Treasures on Earth"
<p>
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also,"
(Matt 6:19-21 NIV).
<li>
16. "Do not Worry about Your Needs"
<p>
"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?" (Matt 6:25-26 NIV). Commandments of Jesus

(Matt 7:1-2 NIV).
<li>

(Matt 7:7 NIV).
<li>
22. "Care for Those in Distress"
<p>
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me,"
(Matt 25:34-36 NIV).
<li>
23. "Enter Through the Narrow Gate"
<p>
"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it,"
(Matt 7:13-14 NIV).

Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted," (Matt 23:8-12 NIV).
<li>
28. "Settle Disputes Between Believers in this Manner..."
<p>
"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector,"
