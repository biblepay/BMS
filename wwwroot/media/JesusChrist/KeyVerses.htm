<h1>Key Bible Verses</h1>

<h3>Key Verses to understand that God is omnipotent (unlimited power), omnipresent (in more than one place at once), and omniscient (knowing all),
 and that God plus Jesus plus The Holy Spirit IS our God:
</h3>

<h4>
<ul>
<li>
The Lord God formed man from dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living being.
(Genesis 2:7)
</li>
<li>
Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations (Jeremiah 1:5).
<li>Surely the Lord GOD does nothing Unless He reveals His secret counsel To His servants the prophets. (Amos 3:7).
<li>
<h3>
Take up the Armor of God:</h3>
<p>
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
<p>
Put on the full armor of God, so that you can make your stand against the devil’s schemes.

<p>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this world’s darkness, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
<p>Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your ground, and having done everything, to stand.
<p>Stand firm then, with the belt of truth fastened around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness arrayed,
and with your feet fitted with the readiness of the gospel of peace.
<p>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
<p>And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
<p>Pray in the Spirit at all times, with every kind of prayer and petition. To this end, stay alert with all perseverance in your prayers for all the saints.
<p>Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, divine utterance may be given me, so that I will boldly make known the mystery of the gospel,
 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly, as I should.
(Ephesians 6:10-20)

<li>
<h3>Ask and it will be given to you</h3>
<p>
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
(Matthew 7:7-8)
<p>
For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
<p>


<li><h3>Watch for False Prophets - Do not be deceived</h3>
<p>
"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
<p>By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
<p>Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
(Matthew 7:15-23)

<li><h3>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit</h3>

<p>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
<p>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
<p>Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.
(Matthew 7:15-23)


<li><h3>Not everyone who says Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven</h3>
<p>
	Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
	(Matthew 7:21-23)

<p>Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?'
And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’


<li>
<h3>In the last days, terrible times will come</h3>
<p>
But understand this: In the last days terrible times will come.
<p>
(2nd Timothy 3:1)

For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents,
ungrateful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderous,
without self-control, brutal, without love of good,
traitorous, reckless, conceited,
lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
having a form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such as these!
(2nd Timothy 3:2)

<p>

They are the kind who worm their way into households and captivate vulnerable women
who are weighed down with sins and led astray by various passions,
always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
(2nd Timothy 3:6)

<p>
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth.
They are depraved in mind and disqualified from the faith.
<p>
But they will not advance much further. For just like Jannes and Jambres, their folly will be plain to everyone.
<p>
<li>
<h3>All Scripture is God-Breathed</h3>
<p>
(2nd Timothy 3:10)

You, however, have observed my teaching, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,
my persecutions, and the sufferings that came upon me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.
<p>
What persecutions I endured!
Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
<p>
Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,
while evil men and impostors go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
<p>

But as for you, continue in the things you have learned and firmly believed, since you know from whom you learned them.
From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
<p>

All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.
(2nd Timothy 3:15)
<li>
<h3>Believe deep in your heart that God raised Jesus from the pit of death - and you will be saved</h3>
<p>
(Romans 10:9-13)
So if you believe deep in your heart that God raised Jesus from the pit of death and if you voice your allegiance by confessing the truth that “Jesus is Lord,” then you will be saved!
<p>
Belief begins in the heart and leads to a life that’s right with God;
confession departs from our lips and brings eternal salvation.
Because what Isaiah said was true: “The one who trusts in Him will not be disgraced.”
Remember that the Lord draws no distinction between Jew and non-Jew—
<p>
He is Lord over all things, and He pours out His treasures on all who invoke His name
because as Scripture says, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
<li>
<h1>God is the Alpha and the Omega</h1>
<p>

Revelation 1:8

I am the Alpha and the Omega, [the very beginning and the very end],
the One who is, the One who was, and the One who is coming: the All Powerful.
