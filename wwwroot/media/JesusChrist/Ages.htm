As established above historically, the human race has existed for approximately 6039 years since Adam and Eve.
It is believed that God has broken down our existence into Ages as shown below:

<h1>The last church age - The Church of Laodicea:</h1>
<p>
"Poor, blind, and naked" (Rev 3:17)
<p>
"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing;
and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,
that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see." (KJV).

<p>

"Behold, I stand" (Rev 3:20)

"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."

<p>
Biblical references that point towards 2017 being the year the tribulation begins:

<p>
<h1>Israel Regains Independence</h1>

Proclaimed on May 14th, 1948, the State of Israel was re-established and declared its independence.

<p>According to this scripture, this would become the starting date for the end time calendar of Daniel´s 70 weeks.
“Seventy weeks are determined For your people and for your holy city,
To finish the transgression,
To make an end of sins, To make reconciliation for iniquity,
To bring in everlasting righteousness, To seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy.
“Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince,
There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times.
(Daniel 9:24-25)
<p>

Just as this scripture indicates, the final 70 year countdown begins "from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem." 1947.
This grouping then is divided in three parts... 62 years, 7 years, and 1 year.

<p>
1947 - 2009.    62 weeks (years)
<p>
2009 - 2016.    7 weeks (years)
<p>
2016 - 2017.    1 week. Year of Jubilee - Deliverance
<p>


Next, basing the length of a generation on Daniels prophetic timeline (70 years), we also see in Matthew 24:34 a similar clue to the date of the end of the church age:

Now learn this lesson from the fig tree:
<p>
As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it [or he] is near, right at the door.
<p>I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. (Matthew 24:32-34)

From Luke:
 Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
 <p> Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. (Luke 21:32)

<p>
From Hosea:

"After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight." (Hosea 6:2)

<p>
Many interpretations exist for this verse, but could it be this - or a dual fulfillment:
<p>
The beginning of the Church Age (0AD, when the Gentile calendar was started, signifying the birth of Christ), (1 day=1000 years) (2 Peter 3:8),
 after 2000 years (after two days he will revive us) - God will raise us up (through Rapture), and on the third day we shall live in his sight (where he is our King
 of the Messianic Kingdom, in the new Millenium).
 <p>
(Dual fulfillment: He was buried, and on the third day, he was raised (1 Corinthians 15:4)).

  This leads us to the assumption that the generation on Earth living after rebirth of the State of Israel in 1948 may be the last generation.
