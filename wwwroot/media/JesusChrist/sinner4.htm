<b>Network with Christians</b>
<p><p>

Congratulations!  Now you are a member of the Kingdom of God!
<p><p>

<br>
Next you should network with like minded individuals (Christians).  You will notice a strange thing, usually after a small period of time:  You can no longer tolerate swearing.  Pesky sins like smoking or drinking have gone out the window.  You have a desire to do good things for others!  What a life!
<br><p><p>


Ask the Holy spirit into your life.  Say, Fill me up God, with the Holy Spirit!  
<br><p><p>

You will become zealous for the Lord.  Start reading the bible.
<p><p>

<br>
Next, learn about how to be baptized in the name of Jesus.
