        <b>Recite the Sinners Prayer</b>

<br>
<br><p><p>

Becoming a Christian is not merely believing some creed or going to church. It is having Christ Himself take residence in your life and heart.
<p><p>

<br>
Jesus said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door,
 I will come in ..."

If you would like to have a relationship with Christ, simply pray this prayer and mean it in your heart:
<br>

<p><p>


"Dear Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner. I believe You died for my sins. Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life. I confess You as my personal Lord and Savior.
<p><p>

<br>
Thank You for saving me. Amen."
