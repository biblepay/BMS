Why are Christians Commanded to Love the Jews?
<h3>
<li>
 The Gentiles were grafted in.  (Romans 11:11).  The Jews committed idolatry, God was upset at the sins committed by his Holy nation, therefore he turned to bless the Gentiles (and this will make the Jews jealous).
   However in the end, God will turn back to save his chosen people, and focus on the Jews again.  This is why we see, that in 1948, Israel regained their independence, and God is turning his focus back on his chosen ones.
   Israel is the land of milk and honey, and the Jews came from all ends of the earth, back to the Nation, as the Bible says they would.
<li>
 Jews are Gods chosen people and will be blessed.  We must support them in order to stay grafted in our vine of life, Jesus.  Let's support the Jews as God turns his focus back on them.
<li>
 Genesis 12:3 - I will bless them that bless Israel and curse those that Curse Thee- this means Israel and Israels people.
<li>
 Romans 15:27 - The Gentiles have Shared in the Jews Spiritual Gifts, they are indebted to minister.
<li>
 Jesus was a Jew himself, and practiced the Mosaic law growing up.
<li>
 Psalm 122:6, Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem, they shall prosper that love the.
<li>
 Luke 7:5, The Gentile deserves the blessing of God because he loves the nation of Israel.
<li>
 Israel was created by an act of GOD
