Have you considered a real mind bender?
<br>


Enoch was born in 3378 BC (or 622 years after Adam, just the seventh man from <a href= http://jesus-christ.us/GenesisTimeline.htm>Adam</a>) and lived for 365 years.
<br>

Enoch was the great grandfather of Noah, writing about events that had not occurred yet (IE the flood of the world), 1400 years before they occurred.
<br>

Now, this book was given to Enoch by divine inspiration, obviously from various good angels (such as Michael, Uriel, Raphiel) because Enoch writes
several things about them (that he was taken up in a vision, to heaven, and given the prophecy).
<br>
<br>


The mind bending part is, Enoch is telling us that God showed him that Nephilim (or Fallen Angels, called Watchers), 20 of them (this is 1/3rd of the angelic
host of Archangels) would turn evil by agreeing with each other that they shall come down from heaven,
pollute the earth, take up fair wives of mortal men, and those women will bear giant men (50 ft tall or taller).
<br>
Some of the gravest sins these fallen angels caused resulted from the destruction that their giant sons caused.   How their new sons (giants) ravaged the earth.
  Enoch writes that the sons ate up everything in sight, destroyed the planet, killed off our smaller men and babies, and in the meantime, the fallen angels taught our society how to do evil
things like make idols, make swords and armaments and elements of war, kill each other, make things like makeup, etc.  And become wizards.
<br>
The mind bending part of all this is God foretold Enoch these Angels would not only do this, but it would lead to a corrupt Earth, one that must be destroyed
by God in a flood.  God foretold that Noah would be righteous and would be saved and will repopulate the earth.
<br>

The evidence for the veracity of these scrolls is that the books of enoch were found in the dead sea scrolls, and Jude quoted Enoch in the new testament.  Therefore Enoch must have existed before the New Testament.
<br>

<ul>Additionally, after reading this book, I am going to summarize some important findings that add to the credibility of this book:
<br>
<li>References to Jesus Christ exist in this book, that are in complete harmony with the book of revelation.
(See <a href=https://book-ofenoch.com/chapter-46/>Enoch chapter 46 (Enoch 46:1-6)</a>).
<li>Jesus is called The Son of Man in here (thousands of years before the New Testament existed), the chosen one, and My Elect.  Father God is called "The Ancient of Days".
<li>Good angels are called Sons of Heaven
 <br>This is a fascinating distinction, that explains Son of Man is the name given by God to Jesus, but the Sons of Man are those made in the likeness of God, first being Adam.  (With Jesus being present
 at the foundation of the world).
 <br>The created beings made in the likeness of Angels are Sons of Heaven.
<li>A very, very, fascinating judgement exists in the book, where God says he will punish those fallen angels by creating Hell, and will bind them
for 4,900 (70 seventies) (<a href=https://book-ofenoch.com/chapter-10/>1 Enoch 10:15</a> until the time of the Great Throne Judgement, then they will be thrown into the lake of fire.  This is a massive statement in many ways!
<br>Why?  Because it confirms so many things, thousands of years before the new testament was written.
<br>First, the flood happened about 1996 BC.  If you add 4900+1996 you get 6896 (or very close to a 7000 year total duration of the age of mankind).
<br>This is fascinating to me, because we know Great Throne occurs at the end of the millenium, and Satan is cast in the lake of fire (from Rev 20:7).
<br>This also confirms a total span of 7000 years, as we HOPE for as Christians who want to go home at the end of the church age (after 6000 years)!  (WHICH IS RIGHT NOW BTW!).
<li>The Jews do not include this book in the old testament, because of the references to the Messiah!  This book adds much more credibility to making Jesus the Messiah.
<br>For example, Jews do not believe in Hell, they dont believe in Satan, they dont believe in a lake of fire, and they do not believe the Messiah was
the anointed one (from the beginning of the foundation of the world).
<br>This book not only confirms hell, what it looks like, that repentance is required, it also confirms things about Angels and Demons!  And how the fallen angels became the force of evil on earth.
<ul>This book also talks about Jesus coming back in his second coming with 10,000 of his saints behind him
<br>
"Behold, he comes with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon them, and destroy the wicked, and reprove all the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly have done, and committed against him”
<br>I believe Jesus even quoted Enoch here:
Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed. (Luke 16:26) by a chasm . . . [are] their souls are separated (Enoch 22: 9,11{22:10,12})
<br>This book also confirms the length of the millenial Kingdom (1000 years), and the teaching of the millenial Kingdom matches Isaiah and Ezekiel (IE the Kingdom will be a much improved version of Jerusalem and then heaven and earth will pass away with great heat and a new heaven and earth will replace them).

God Bless you!
