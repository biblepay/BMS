<h1>
	The Name of Our Lord
</h1>

<p>
"Jesus Christ" or "Yeshua Ha Mashiach"?

<h3>
What is the meaning of our Lord's Name, and what other names did Jesus go by?
<h2>
<p>
<h2>

Where did <b>"YESHUA HA MASHIACH" come from?
<p>

Today in English our Lord is commonly referred to as "Jesus Christ", as
if "Jesus" was His first name and "Christ" was His last name.
<p>
In actuality, His name in Hebrew and Aramaic (the languages He spoke) was
<p>
"Yeshua", which means salvation. During His life on earth, He was called
"Yeshua".
<p>

At the time Yeshua lived on earth, kings were given their authority in
ceremonies where they were anointed with olive oil. Yeshua was known as
the "Mashiach" (Messiah) or The Anointed One having been anointed with
God's authority. Thus He was known as "Yeshua Ha Mashiach", or Yeshua
the Anointed One.
<p>
THEN WHY "JESUS CHRIST"?
<p>
In Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, "Yeshua" was translated as
"Iesous" which was probably pronounced "yay-soos" in ancient Greek and
is pronounced "yee-soos" in modern Greek. The word "Jesus" then came
from an English translation of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament.
<p>
The word for "Mashiach" in Greek is "Christos" meaning anointed. This
word is usually brought into English as "Christ".
<p>
Unfortunately, through these translations we've lost the true meaning of
our Lord's name.

Summary: In Hebrew, Jesus' name is <h1>YESHUA HA MASHIACH.</h1>

<p>Please memorize his name so that you are familiar with his name in more than one language.
