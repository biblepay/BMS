<h1>Christianity Ultimate and Absolute Truth</h1>
<p>
A. K. H. Boyd, D. D.

(1 Corinthians 3:11)
For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
<p>


<p>

1. What we know of the way of the world hitherto prepares us to believe that a great many things which are now serving their purpose will be superseded.
(In communication, no one can say that the telegraph is the ultimate wonder. And in all the arts and conveniences of life, the case is so too.)

<p>

2. There is one thing, however, which will never be superseded.
<p>
The world has seen various religions; but the truth, as it is in Jesus, is <b>absolute and ultimate truth.</b>
<p>
We may have to learn, perhaps, that things which we think to be part of Christianity, are not, and to give them up as our fathers had.
<p>
But, in the face of all possibilities, we turn to the comfortable assurance in the text.
<p>
There is no "Christ that is to be": the One Christ has come (edit: Boyd says Once and for all, although we anticipate a second coming).
<p>

<ul>Among the ultimate and unchangeable truths are:
<li>
I. THE WAY IN WHICH EACH OF US MUST BE SAVED.
<p>
A vital thing, which cannot go amid all coming changes, is salvation through the atonement of Christ.
<p>We are sure of nothing if we are not sure that "Christ died for our sins."

<p>
And no theory of the way of salvation but that which is familiar to us can bear being calmly looked at by any man who feels it his duty to accept the
Word of God as decisive.
<p>We do not think that it is in any way profitable to push revealed doctrine into minute details; but we cannot regard it as other than vital part of that foundation besides which there never can be another,
that Christ is a Saviour: that His sufferings were sacrificial, and borne for us: that by His obedience and death He reconciles us to God,
satisfies Divine justice, and secures sanctification as well as forgiveness: that His atoning work is complete,
and that its benefits are offered freely to all who will receive them.
<li>II. THE RULE OF DUTY AND HELP IN DUTY.
<p>
1. You are not more sure of your own existence than that the requirements of Christianity as to duty will never grow less
and can never grow greater.
<p>
You cannot conceive of anything beyond perfection. Nor can you recall anything that lies outside of "whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,"
. And there is set before us for constraining example the life of One who was sinless in humanity, perfect in Godhead; and we are bidden to grow like Him.
<li>2. Then, as for the help for all this there can be no change. As for the grace, guidance, vitality of the Holy Spirit — these, too, will be needed and are guaranteed to the end.
<p>
Conclusion: There may be other things nearly associated with the scheme of Christian belief which will endure.
<p>
Christian worship, surely, must always abide, though the accessories may greatly change.
<p>Surely there must be prayer, and praise; and even preaching must in some shape last. "Till He come" again, too, the sacramental commemoration of the Great Sacrifice,
and the feeding upon it by faith, is appointed to continue.
<p>
Yet it is rather doctrine than ritual that is pointed to in the text.
