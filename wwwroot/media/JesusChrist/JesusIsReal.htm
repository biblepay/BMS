20+ Reasons to Stop Being an Atheist

</h1>
<p>


<p>
<h3>

The risk of being an atheist or choosing a non-Jesus religion is: going to Hell, and suffering eternally.


<p>

<ul>

Reasons that God Exists, and Christ is Real:

<li>

Divine Creation or Darwinism?

The logical conclusion is not that we evolved from monkeys, or that the big bang created all matter.
By observing that thousands of transmuted species do not exist leads one to the conclusion that we have a Divine creator.

Besides, science is the observation of current physical laws through a model with a cosmological constant (IE an error correcting factor).
God is not bound by time, space or physical laws.
Consider for a moment that he has the ability to change them, and that the infrastructure was created by God.

Enough evidence exists around us in the galaxy to show that a Divine Creator exists
(Romans 1:20)

<li>
Many have had NDEs, visions or warnings given by God to prove that Hell Exists, and they have awaken shaken to their core.
They simply know what they saw was real, and their entire life purpose changes to being dedicated to spreading the truth to the world.

<li>
This video is a real wake up call.  This man was shown Jesus, during the time of the end, on judgement day judging souls.  It makes one wonder if we extended God's Kingdom enough during our lives
 to be worthy of Heaven.  It also makes us remember that we must forgive everyone and hold no grudges.

<li>
Many Real rapture videos - People waking in a cold sweat and sincere, lives purpose has been changed.  Note that rapture dream frequency has increased exponentially in recent years.
<li>
Many believe if they were good to others they will go to heaven.  Atheists often believe life simply ends when they are buried.
The truth cannot be sugar coated: Since God breathed life into each man, you have a commitment to find Christ.  A dead atheist goes to hell.  (Ref: Heaven and Hell testimonies).

<li>
Many believe all religions lead to God via different roads, and therefore those roads lead them to heaven.  This is not the case.  Non Jesus based religions lead a soul to Hell (Allah, Buddah are in hell) already.
 (Ref : Non Christian religions, where people call for their foreign God in an NDE never receive an answer, but when calling for Jesus, Jesus always answers.

<li>

Life is about extending Gods Kingdom - not about Idolatry (Placing hobbies ahead of God).
<li>

In this age, 6000 years have elapsed, and current events place us toward the <a href=http://jesus-christ.us/Clock.htm>"End Times" (2 Peter 3:8) One day with the Lord is as 1000 years; A week is Six Days + 1 day of rest</a>

<li>

The Bible is God breathed and written of Divine inspiration - not written by man as some assume (God's apostles wrote down what was given in visions, dreams etc) some examples include
: God gave the entire dimensions to the temple and temple utensils and Gold overlays to the exact cubit before being built, plans for Noahs ark,
 future events prophesied by Isaiah, Moses was handed the ten commandments on the mountain, Christ was prophesied about many times in the old testament before birth,
  All of Abrahams descendents were listed in a hierarchical vision around Exodus-
that is something no man can do back then without tracking geneology etc like we do today.
<p>
<li>
Geneology of Genesis - Star of Bethlehem - a consistent pattern exists for : Birth of Adam (6000 years ago), Birth of
Abraham (4000 years ago - the father of the Jews), Birth of Christ - 2000 years ago, and finally - the Birth of the Millenial Kingdom -
where the King of Kings will Rule on Earth: Coming in approximately 7 years <a href=http://jesus-christ.us/StudyOfDaniel.htm>(Ref: Daniels Timeline book of Daniel - Daniels 70th week, being in the 69th week of Daniels Timeline)</a>


<li>
Heaven is Real - Mary K Baxter - Mary was taken to heaven 40 times over 40 days, and gifted with an unreal level of detail in Heaven
and tours the country speaking of the experiences.
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuxVr5f9RhA target=_blank>See Heaven is Real by Mary Baxter</a>
<li>
Maria Valtorta - A victim soul from Italy - hit by a pipe as a teenager - bedridden - wrote the entire full details of Jesus life over 40 years as
shown in a vision to an Italian scribe - available in PDF format.

<li>

The corroboration of Heavenly testimonies, containing hieracrchies of angels, abilities, surroundings and order in heaven
<li>

The corroboration of Hell Testimonies, containing the smell, the demons behavior, the behavior of the body, the breathing
<li>
The sincerity of hell dreams and rapture dreams (people compelled to record a video at 4 am and still sweating)
 provides compelling evidence of the afterlife
<li>
The corroboration on the behavior of the Soul when leaving the body and reentering the body (A man is Body, Soul and Spirit)
<li>An unprecedented number of God's watchmen are currently warning us that we are in the last days, near the church rapture
<li>
The antichrist spirit has entered the world political system (Pro LGBT, Pro abortion, Corruption of judicial system,
anti-Israel land treaties, rise of ISIS, Christian persecution, removal of God from education and society, corrupted media,
moral decay, decay of the family unit, lovers of self  etc)
<li>
The rise of Tribulation/Revelations prophesied events (Wars, rumors of wars, earthquakes in diverse places,
mass animal deaths and fish kills, FEMA camps, a NWO, shackled train cars, billions of rounds of ammo)
<li>
Consistent testimonies of judgement day: Jesus will judge every man, and while reviewing everything this person did in life, wearing Kingdom
filtration glasses, will only see how his Kingdom was extended.  Non repentant backsliding Christians, and non-Christians will go to hell,
for Eternal punishment.
<li>
Miraculous healings on YouTube: Miracles done in the name of Jesus are consistent, but miracles in other names are inconsistent and do not last.
<li>

Jesus is the Only way to achieve everlasting life - he is standing at the Narrow Gate to let you in.
