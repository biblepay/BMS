<h1>
Psalm 23
</h1>
<small>21st Century King James Version (KJ21)</small>

<h2>
<p>
1  The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
<p>

2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He leadeth me beside the still waters.
<p>

3 He restoreth my soul; 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake.
<p>

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will fear no evil; 
<p>
for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
<p>

5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
<p>

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<p>
