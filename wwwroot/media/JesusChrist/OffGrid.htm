<h3>Off Grid - Survival Guide</h3>

In these perilous times it is paramount we have the ability to perform basic emergency survival functions for our family in preparation for a catastrophe.
Think the ability to live off Grid.

<br>
In this concise guide we provide you with the basic ideas that will prepare you for living in a disaster scenario.

<br>

<ul>Implement the Basics - Think on a one to seven year scale
<li>Prayer - As in 1 Kings 17:7, God multiplied the widows flour for Elijah and her.  Remember God is the primary Jehovah Jireh, and we must lean on God the most
and not put faith in our own preparedness.  God is the Key to all of our survival needs.  But we were not born helpless and we have the energy to provide the base that God can use to
multiply.  We also must remember to Love our neighbor as ourselves in trying times and not be selfish.  The widow was the example of NOT being selfish so God did multiply the last of their
flour - and it did not run out.
  Finally, prepping can not only offer some security for your family but more importantly for those left behind in the rapture.
God will lead those who are left behind, like the animals in Noahs ark to your food for a blessing for them.
<li>
Have Food Available:
<br>
Method 1.
<br>
Buy grains or emergency food kits, and store these inside.  The food should preferably have a long shelf life and be 10-50 lbs in a sealed container.
Example of <a href= https://www.amazon.com/Augason-Farms-Rolled-Emergency-Storage/dp/B00LBGQ39O/> 10 lbs of rolled oats (long shelf life prepacked) </a>.
<br>
Example of <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Augason-Farms-5-20091-Emergency-Servings/dp/B071KPGLBK> 25 lbs emergency foods.</a>
<br>

Some other examples:  20 lbs of cornmeal, 25 lbs wheat berries, 25 lbs rice, 25 lbs of flour, etc.
Note that if you buy your own bags of grain, they can become moldy from moisture over time and dangerous to eat,
  so we recommend packing them properly for long term storage (with oxygen absorbers, in sealed 5 gallon home depot buckets).
<br>
Finally, if you are very cost concious you can buy
<a href=https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/producers-pride-whole-corn-50-lb>50 lbs deer corn, at todays prices : $9.00</a>.
<br>
(Deer corn is most likely safe to eat for emergency living).

<br>
I also recommend buying some large bags of sugar, and oil.  Sugar never goes bad and oil has a long shelf life.

<br>
Method 2:
<br>
Grow your own food.  You can start a garden, and set up a sustainable supply of fruits and vegetables.
However we still recommend having some bags of grain as a backup.

<li>Ability to boil water - this basic necessity allows you to disinfect water that has been stored - or even rainwater
Allows you to prepare meals from powdered emergency food kits, etc.
Buy bags of charcoal and keep them on hand with lighter fluid and lighters and matches.  Also buy a flint so you can make fires
without relying on matches.  Test the ability to make a fire with each method.
<li>Store 50 gallons (or more) of water:
You can set up a 55 gallon drum of water
<a href=https://www.bayteccontainers.com/new55gawaba.html>using a plastic drum such as this one.</a>
<br>
Fill the drum up with water from your house while times are good.
Buy water
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/EDWARDS-COUNCILOR-Steramine-Sanitizing-Tablet/dp/B07G7SJXQJ/>
disinfectant tablets, so that you can disinfect old water (or questionable water).</a>



<li>Cooking food off grid - Be sure you have a way to cook food.
<br>
You can use charcoal, and another option is buying a wood pellet grill.
<br>
Wood pellet grills do require 150watts of AC power, but the advantage is a 50lb bag of wood pellets can last a long time.
If you go with wood pellets, you should store extra bags of wood pellets in your house (away from moisture).
You then need to buy a solar panel and an inverter, to power your pellet grill from the sun.
<br>
But I stress:  Focus on the ability to cook with charcoal and a fire first so you are not relying on electricity.
<br>
You can also look into buying firewood and storing it.  You can put a piece of wood on the fire and rely less on charcoal, etc.
Remember to buy extra charcoal lighter fluid and grill lighters and flint.
<li>Staying Warm - Get Blankets and long johns and undergarments and sweaters - Even though we have hot weather in the summer, there
is a strong possibility that the winter will be exceedingly cold off grid.  It will be impossible to keep a fire going to warm your house,
so it is very important to survive directly with clothing and blankets day to day.

<li>Light - We need to see each other and read, so we should stock up on candles and/or oil lamps.
