<h1>
	<u>Rapture Ready Checklist</u>
</h1>


<h4>
<font size=4>
The rapture: Christians believe that before the great tribulation, the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the LORD in the air. (1 Thessalonians 4:17)

<p>

Remember, we are saved by Grace and Faith, not our own Works, so we cannot work to Be raptured, but we can work towards Deserving to be Raptured,
 as it is through the mercy of Jesus that we are Raptured, and we must pray that we are worthy, so we shall focus
 our energy on becoming holy enough to stand before the Son of Man.
<p>

To that end, we have compiled a list of things that help us align ourselves to be in the presence of the Lord, so to become worthy to stand in front of him.
<p>
Why be raptured?  See our tribulation page on the details of the great tribulation.  No mortal will wish they are still alive if they are left behind after the rapture.

<p>
<ul><H3>How to be ready for the Rapture, and stand in the presence of Jesus Christ:</h3>

<font size=5></b>

<li>
<font color=red><b>TRUST IN JESUS:</b>
</font>
Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ's authentic Merit for Salvation, Sanctification - Forever and for Eternity.  Do Not trust in your own worthiness to be able to save yourself.
(Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God) (2 Corinthians 3:5).
<li>
<font color=red><b>
BE SAVED:</b></font>
Be Saved by Jesus (you have recited the Sinners Prayer), and are currently living by the Faith of the Son of God, Who loved [us], and gave Himself for [us] (Galatians 2:20).
(Recommendation: Get Baptized.)
<li>
<font color=red><b>MARK OF THE BEAST:</b></font>
Decide now that you will never take the mark of the beast on your right hand or your forehead, or worship the graven image of the beast.
This helps your worthiness as you are proclaiming that Evil is not for you.
<li>
<font color=red><b>PRAY DAILY:</b></font>
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man. (Luke 21:36)
<li>
<font color=red><b>REMOVE IDOLATRY:</b></font>
Prioritize God above everything in your life: Above your family, above your TV shows, above the internet, above your hobbies, and above your job, and study the word of the bible with zeal for a
considerable amount of time per day, as you never know if a day may come where your electronic devices and books are taken away, but no one can take away the word of God once it is in your heart.
<li>
<font color=red><b>BE A WATCHMAN, AND PRIORITIZE GOD:</b></font>
Do not be caught up in a hedonistic or materialistic lifestyle:
And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting,
and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares (Luke 21:34).
Surfeiting is equivalent to overindulging in something, similar to idolatry (prioritizing any activity above God).
Another words, in these end-times, we need to be focused on the word, spreading the gospel, and prioritizing God, and not be caught up in the cares of this world.
<li>
<font color=red><b>FORGIVE EVERYONE:</b></font>
Forgive others for everything that was ever done to you.  This ensures your prayers, and therefore your repentances will be heard when you ask for forgiveness.
<li>
<font color=red><b>REPENT:</b></font>
  Repent all of your sins.
  <p>See our <a href=sins.htm>SINS</a> section;
  work through all sins that you are convicted of and repent.

<li>
<font color=red><b>DROP ALL GRUDGES:</b></font>
Do not hold grudges.  This ensures your prayers will be heard, as how can you ask for forgiveness while holding grudges on others?
<li>
<font color=red><b>SPREAD THE GOSPEL:</b></font>
Save others by making them aware of Jesus Christ.  You are potentially saving their soul.  Realize that on judgement day, it is very likely that during a review of your life you may be made aware of times
when you did not share the Good News of Jesus Christ with a friend.
<li>
<font color=red><b>GIVE AWAY YOUR EXCESS:</b></font>
Store up your treasures in heaven.  Give away your excess assets to the poor.
No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
  You cannot serve God and mammon. (Matthew 6:24) (See also: Luke 16:13)
  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. (Matthew 6:21)
<p>
And [Jesus] said to them, “Take heed, and beware of all covetousness;
for a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”
 ... So is he who lays up treasure for himself, [and] is not rich toward God.” (Luke 12:15-21)

<li>
<font color=red><b>HELP WIDOWS AND ORPHANS AND THE POOR:</b></font>
Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
(James 1:27)
<p>
Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father... (1 Timothy 5:1)
<p>
What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
(James 2:14)
