<p>

Thank you for stopping by.
<p>
My friends we live in perilous times, the State of the World is currently under heightened military tension and now it's imperative that everyone Get Right with God and worship
 the one true Saviour: Jesus Christ.
 <p>
 According to our Biblical Chronology page, we are now approaching the end of the Church Age (close to the new Millenium/Messianic Kingdom).
 <p>
 What this means is the human race may be close to transitioning over to something entirely new, something majestic!  It's God's will to put us here for 6000 years (from the day Adam and Eve were born),
 to today, to give us an infrastructure to learn and work, and to bear good fruit.
 <p>
 That age is almost over, and in the new age, we will live under Jesus's reign as our King on Earth, and lay down with lions and leopards and our children will pet the lions and they will not fear being bitten.

 <p>
 <p> So it is of the utmost importance to be on the right team!  If you are caught unaware, and for example, serving a false God, all you will experience here on Earth is pain and suffering.
 You will be left behind to go through a seven year tribulation, something like World War III, and then, you will be tempted to take the Mark of the Beast, and go through great famine and testing.
 <p> Ultimately if you dont choose Jesus, when you die you will go to a place of gnashing of teeth.

 So, before you leave, I want you to find out if you are a sheep, a lost sheep, or a goat.  And then take a stroll over to the corresponding area.  I urge you to consider Christ if you are a goat.
 <p>
 <ul>
 We all fit into certain categories: Those who are Christian and Lost (The Lost Sheep),
  those Christians who are Saved followers living in the Spirit (The Sheep), and those who are atheists or following a non-Christian religion (the Goats).


<li><h2><u>  The Goats</h2></u>

<p>
<h2>
	You fit into the Goat category if you are an Atheist, Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, Bahai, Sikh, Tribal or Non-Christian.
	<p>

	A goat is someone who risks going to hell after judgement day, because this person was made aware of the Good News, made aware of the existence of Jesus Christ,
	 and yet rejected the message.  (2nd Thessalonians 1:8-9; Revelation 20:15).

    <p>
	 	 	 	 I urge you to look at our <a href=JesusChrist.htm>Getting Saved</a> page,
	 	 	 	 and watch some of the youtube videos on NDEs pertaining to people of your faith and what happened to
	 those people when they called out for their God while in Hell- one person called to Allah, no answer,
	 called for Jesus, and he was there.
	 <p>Another saw Buddha in hell, and Buddha could not save them, but Jesus can.
	    I urge you to receive Jesus in your heart.
	 <p>

</li>

<li><h2><u>The Lost Sheep:</u></h2>

<p>
<h3>
You are one of the Lost Sheep if you call yourself a Christian, but have either been backsliding, are lukewarm, or simply have not prioritized God.
Do not despair, we are here to help you get on track.
<p>

  Some surprising examples of lost sheep include:  People who attend megachurches, where the pastor does not preach about Hell or churches that skip preaching the word,
  or churches that are only interested in raising money.
  <p>
  Those who try to change the word of the bible and justify it to suit their own lifestyle.
  Those who commit idolatry and/or prioritize daily life above God:
  playing video games, surfing the internet, watching TV, prioritizing your business above God, all of these things are OK in moderation,
  but of grave risk when you prioritize these things above God.  You should read the bible and pray FIRST and if there is any time left in the day, then continue.

  <p><b>
  "And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting,
  and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares "(Luke 21:34).</b>
  Surfeiting is equivalent to overindulging in something, similar to idolatry (prioritizing any activity above God).


  <p>
  For example, when Obama was asked if he believed people would go to Hell who did not embrace Jesus Christ, his answer was:
  <font size=3>
  <p>"I find it hard to believe that my God would consign four-fifths of the world to hell.
  I can’t imagine that my God would allow some little Hindu kid in India who never interacts with the
   Christian faith to somehow burn for all eternity.
   That’s just not part of my religious makeup."</font>
   <p>
 In reality, Jesus is the only way to heaven.
   Anyone who tries to change the bible for their own satisfaction is on the road to hell.
   <p>
  Once Obama said the definition of sin is: Being out of alignment with my [own] values.
  <p>However, the correct standard of sinning is always the Bibles definition of each sin, and that never changes.
  <p>See our <a href=sins.htm>Sins</a> page.
  <p>
  If you will gladly share your memory of being Saved (when you recited the Sinners Prayer), and feel confident in trusting that Jesus will take you to Heaven, you are not lost.
  <p>
  Roman Catholics:
  <p>
  It is not our intent to steer anyone away from Jesus but make your relationship closer.
   Some <a href=RomanCatholics.htm> questions arise in regard to certain aspects </a> of Roman Catholicism.  It is our duty to at least point these out and let you choose the flavor of Christianity where Jesus appears strongest to you within.


  <p>
  But if you are guilty, as many are, of justifying why you no longer attend church, you deproritize serving the Lord, you aren't praying for the sick,
  you are backsliding, confused or feel uncertain about where your soul will go if you died tonight,
   please consider fully giving your life to Jesus Christ by visiting our <a href=JesusChrist.htm>Getting Saved</a> page.



<li><h3><u>The Sheep:</u></h3>
<p>
<h3>
If you are one of Jesus' sheep, you are a follower of him and secure in his promise of salvation.
<p>You should ensure that each day you pray to be worthy of the rapture, stay deep in the word,
and keep repenting any sins.
<p><h5><b><u>"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man." (Luke 21:36)</u></b></h5>


<p>
Please spread the gospel, and try to save others.  Consider giving away your excess.  See the <a href=RichMan.htm>Rich Mans Page</a>.
<p>
Congratulations, you are on your way to heaven!  (Also, please see our <a href=rapturereadychecklist.htm>Rapture Ready page</a>).
