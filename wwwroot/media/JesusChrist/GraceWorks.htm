<h1>
Are we saved by Grace+Faith, Works, or Grace+Works?
</h1>

<p>
Across various Christian religions, some profess salvation requires God's Grace plus works while Others believe God's Grace alone will deliver you to heaven.

<p>

By reading the bible, we find that Jesus is certainly capable of saving us alone through his Grace.
<p>
Let's start by ruling out what we can't do: We can't do good works to get to heaven.  We are all born sinners and will never be able to make it on our own into heaven.
 In the era of the Law, the Jews had to follow the commandments plus orthodox traditions to please God, but in the church age we must trust that Jesus did all of the work for us.
 <p>It is Grace+Faith alone that will allow us to enter heaven, since Jesus did all of the work.
 <p>However, the bible points out that we should bear good fruit, and do good works to set an example for other Christians once we are saved.
 <P>We should strive to be more perfect Christians.
<UL>
<li>
Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior
<li>Believe that he died on the cross and trust in him, and through this faith his Grace will save your soul.
<li>
To walk with him after being saved, you should try to set a good example for other Christian brothers and sisters:
	<ul>
	<li>
	  Jesus brother James said we are "justified by works too and not by faith alone".
	  <li>  Jesus said "if you start plowing (plowing is work) and turn back, you are not worthy of the Kingdom" AND "if you deny Me, I will deny you".
	  <li>
	    We are to take up our cross, forgive others, get baptized, bear good fruit or get thrown into the fire (Jn. 15:6; Mt. 7:19; 3:10),
	    <p>  hate your life in this world to keep it for eternal life (Jn. 12:25), continue to do the will of the Heavenly Father to live forever (Mt. 7:21; 1 Jn. 2:17),
<p>  Sow to please the spirit Gal 6:8,  Do what is to be righteous Jn 3:7,
<p>  keep making an agonizing EFFORT to enter Gods kingdom doors for many who try will not enter (Lk.13:23,24), stand firm
<p>  through hatred to the end to be saved (Mt. 10:22).

<p>
<li>Prioritize Jesus above your everyday pleasures- do not choose distracting habits that allow him to be choked out.
<li> Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.

</ul>

<li>
<h3> How to be a person who bears good fruit:</h3>
<p>
 The fruit of the Spirit of God is “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control”.
 You should strive to emit those characteristics, to avoid being thrown in the lake of burning fire.
 How will you smell to God, when he walks through the garden and smells your soul?  Will it be sweet smelling fruit?
 (Bear Good fruit or be thrown into the fire Mt 7:19)
<li>
<h3>
God Commands us, by the spirit, put to death the misdeeds of the body to live:
 (ROMANS 8:13)
</h3>
<p>

<b> For if your life is just about satisfying the impulses of your sinful nature,
  then prepare to die.

<p>
  But if you have invited the Spirit to destroy these selfish desires, you will experience life. (Romans 8:13)

<p>
 	<a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEm3cR45E4c>Don't focus on Hedonism!</a>

<li>

	Persist in doing Good so that God will give you eternal life (Romans 2:7)
Live holy or the second death will have power over you (Hebrews 12:14)
Be afraid and not arrogant of getting cut off like the Jews (Romans 11:20)

<p>

Forgive others who sin against you so that your sins can be forgiven (Mt. 6:14,15)
   and so you wont be accountable once again for your previously forgiven sins (Mt. 18:21-35).
