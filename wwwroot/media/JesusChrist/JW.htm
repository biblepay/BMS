<p>The Jehovah's Witness organization claims to be the only true Christian group in the entire world. It says that all other churches, whether Catholic or Protestant, teach error and that anyone who is not a Jehovah's Witness will be destroyed by God. However, the facts show that this group is a deceptive sect. Here are four reasons why they should be avoided.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #005100;"> <strong>1. The Jehovah's Witnesses deny the central teachings of the Bible.</strong></span><br /> <br /> <strong>The Jehovah's Witness organization denies that Jesus Christ is God.</strong> Instead they teach that Jesus Christ is a created angel.</p>
<div class="pullquote" style="clear: right;">"The facts show that this group is a deceptive sect."</div>
<p>However, the Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ, the Son, is God. For example, Hebrews 1:8 says, "But about the Son he says, 'Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever ...' " Many other verses also teach this — John 1:1, 14; 20:26-28; Acts 20:28; Romans 9:5; Hebrews 1:3, 8-9; 2 Peter 1:1.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jehovah's Witnesses deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ.</strong> Instead they teach that Jesus' body was dissolved into gases. Charles Taze Russell, founder of the organization taught, "The man Jesus is dead, forever dead" (<em>Studies in the Scriptures</em>, Vol. 5, 1899, p. 454). <br /> <br /> However, the Bible clearly teaches that Jesus' body was raised back to life: For example, Luke 24:39 — "Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see I have." See also — John 2:19-21; John 20:26-28; 1 Corinthians 15:6,14.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Holy Spirit is God.</strong> Instead they teach that the Holy Spirit is a impersonal force, like electricity.<br /> <br /> However, the Bible clearly teaches that the Holy Spirit is God: Acts 5:3,4 — "Then Peter said, Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit ... You have not lied to men but to God." See also John 14:16-17; 16:13-15; Romans 8:26-27; 2 Corinthians 3:6,17-18; Ephesians 4:30.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jehovah's Witnesses deny that salvation is God's free gift. </strong>Instead they teach that salvation must be earned or merited. To obtain salvation and escape judgment, a person must join and do the works prescribed by the Jehovah's Witness organization. <br /> <br /> However, the Bible clearly teaches that salvation cannot be earned or merited — it is God’s free gift: Ephesians 2:8-9 — "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith — and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God — not by works, so that no one can boast." See also: Romans 4:1-4; Galatians 2:16; Titus 3:5.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jehovah's Witnesses deny the endless punishment of the wicked.</strong> Instead they teach that unrighteous people will be annihilated and cease to exist.<br /> <br /> However, the Bible clearly teaches the endless punishment of the wicked: Matthew 25:41, 46 — "Then he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels .... Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life." See also: Matthew 18:8; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9; Revelation 14:10, 11; 20:10, 15.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jehovah's Witnesses deny that human beings have a spirit that exists after death. </strong>Instead they teach that like animals, a person's life ceases to exist at death.<br /> <br /> However, the Bible clearly teaches that the human spirit continues a conscious existence after death: 2 Corinthians 5:8 — "We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord." See also: Luke 16:19-31; Philippians 1:23-24; Revelation 6:9-11.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jehovah's Witnesses teach that eternal life in God's presence is only for a select few. </strong>They claim that only a special group of 144,000 Jehovah's Witnesses can be born again and live forever with God in heaven; all other Jehovah's Witnesses stay on earth.<br /> <br /> However, the Bible clearly teaches that all those who put their faith in Jesus Christ will have eternal life in the presence of God. The Bible refers to this group as an innumerable multitude: Revelation 7:9, 15 — "After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb ... they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple." See also: John 3:15; 5:24;12:26; Ephesians 2:19; Philippians 3:20; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 3:1; 12:22; 2 Peter 1:10,11.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Three-in-One nature of God (Trinity) and teach that Satan invented the doctrine of the Trinity. </strong>They reject all the scriptures that identify Jesus Christ as God and the Holy Spirit as God.<br /> <br /> However, the Bible clearly teaches that the Son and the Holy Spirit, as well as the Father are God (John 1:1; 20:28; 1 John 5:20; Acts 5:3, 4). It also clearly and forcefully teaches that there is only one God (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6,8; etc.). It teaches that the Three are one — a Trinity (Matthew 28:19; 1 Corinthians 12:4-6; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 Peter 1:2).<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Is it not dangerous to follow an organization that denies the central teachings of the Bible?<br /> </em></strong> <br /> <span style="color: #005100;"><strong>2. The Jehovah's Witnesses Tamper with the Bible.</strong></span><br /> <br /> The Jehovah's Witness organization has produced its own bogus version of the Bible. This version is called the New World Translation. It contains deliberate changes to many verses of Scripture. These changes try to hide the fact that Jehovah's Witness teaching is unbiblical and false.</p>

<p><br /> <em><strong>Is it not dangerous to follow an organization that tampers with Holy Scripture?<br /> </strong></em> <br /> <span style="color: #005100;"><strong>3. The Jehovah's Witnesses Have a History of Failed Prophecies.</strong></span><br /> <br /> The leaders of the Jehovah's Witnesses claim to speak for Jehovah God with prophetic authority but they have made many prophecies that failed to come true. For example, they predicted that Armageddon and the end of the world would come in 1975. To cover up for this failure, most Jehovah's Witnesses today deny they made this prediction even though it is easily proven from their own literature.<strong><a href="#_irr_end1" title="End Note #1" class="see-footnote ref" id="_irr_end_ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></strong><br /> <br /> The Jehovah's Witness organization also predicted that the end of the world would come in 1914, 1915, 1918, 1925 and 1942. They predicted that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would be resurrected and return to the earth in 1925. They have been wrong every single time.<strong><a href="#_irr_end2" title="End Note #2" class="see-footnote ref" id="_irr_end_ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></strong> The Bible declares that failed prophecy is a mark of a false prophet (Deuteronomy 18:21-22).<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Is it not dangerous to follow an organization with a history of failed prophecies?</strong></em><br /> <br /> <span style="color: #005100;"><strong>4. The Jehovah's Witness Organization Uses Its Authority Abusively.</strong></span><br /> <br /> In spite of its many failed prophecies, the Jehovah's Witness organization teaches that it is the only true religion, and that only its members are true Christians. It claims that no one can learn spiritual truth apart from them. It also teaches that there is salvation only in joining their organization and everyone but Jehovah's Witnesses will be destroyed at Armageddon.<br /> <br /> The Jehovah's Witnesses organization demands that its members obey and accept, unquestioningly, every command and biblical interpretation given by the organization.<br /> <br /> For example, the Jehovah's Witnesses organization prohibits the use of blood transfusions. Individual Jehovah's Witnesses are expected to die or let their children die, rather than break this command, even though the Scriptures nowhere teach that blood transfusions are wrong. Any Jehovah's Witness that disobeys this rule is told he will be destroyed at the coming of Armageddon — the time of final judgment.<br /> <br /> In this way the leaders use fear and intimidation to keep members obedient to the organization. The leaders of the Jehovah's Witnesses have also used their predictions of the end of the world to put fear into the hearts of their followers.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Is it not dangerous to follow an organization that uses its authority abusively?</strong></em><br />  </p>

<p><br /> These four points illustrate the spiritual dangers associated with the Jehovah's Witness organization. Maybe you are wondering "What is the good news of the Bible?" The following four points present the true gospel of Jesus Christ as found in the Bible.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #005100;"><strong>How to find Peace with God</strong></span><br /> <br /> The message of the Bible can be summarized in four simple points:<br /> <br /> <strong>1. We are separated from the true and living God by our sins. </strong> <br /> "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Romans 3:23<br /> "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Romans 6:23<br /> <br /> <strong>2. We cannot save ourselves.</strong><br /> "Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin." Romans 3:20<br /> "He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy." Titus 3:5<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Jesus Christ is God's remedy for our sin problem.</strong><br /> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." John 3:16<br /> "For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God." 1 Peter 3:18a<br /> <br /> <strong>4. We must personally receive Jesus Christ by faith to have forgiveness of sins and eternal life.</strong><br /> "Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God." John 1:12<br /> "... if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you will be saved." Romans 10:9<br />  </p>
<hr />
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /> If these truths from God's Word have touched your heart, you can respond right now by asking Him to forgive your sins and give you new life in Christ. This simple prayer may guide you in expressing your faith in Jesus Christ for salvation.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #005100;"><strong>Prayer<br /> </strong></span> <br /> <em>Almighty and merciful God, I acknowledge that I have sinned against you in my deeds, words, and thoughts. I fall short of your righteousness, and cannot save myself. Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to shed his blood for me. I ask you to forgive me of all my sins, and I place my trust in Jesus Christ, who died in my place, and who rose from the dead. Amen</em>.<br />  </p>
