<P>Equally amazing to the doctrine of the Trinity is the doctrine of the
Incarnation — that Jesus Christ is God and man, yet one person, forever. As J.I.
Packer has said, “Here are two mysteries for the price of one — the plurality of
persons within the unity of God, and the union of Godhead and manhood in the
person of Jesus. . . . Nothing in fiction is so fantastic as is this truth of
the Incarnation.”<A name="ftnref1" title="ftnref1"></A><SUP><A href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man#ftn1">1</A></SUP></P>
<P>The early church considered the Incarnation to be one of the most important
truths of our faith. Because of this, they formulated what has come to be called
the Chalcedonean Creed, a statement which sets forth what we are to believe and
what we are not to believe about the Incarnation. This creed was the fruit of a
large council that took place from October 8 to November 1, 451, in the city of
Chalcedon and “has been taken as the standard, orthodox definition of the
biblical teaching on the person of Christ since that day by” all the major
branches of Christianity.<A name="ftnref2" title="ftnref2"></A><SUP><A href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man#ftn2">2</A></SUP>
There are five main truths with which the creed of Chalcedon summarized the
biblical teaching on the Incarnation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.  Jesus has two natures  —  He is God and man.<BR> 2.  Each
  nature is full and complete  —  He is fully God and fully man.<BR> 3.  Each
  nature remains distinct.<BR> 4.  Christ is only one Person.<BR> 5.  Things
  that are true of only one nature are nonetheless true of the Person of
Christ.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A proper understanding of these truths clears up much confusion and many
difficulties we may have in our mind. How can Jesus be both God and man? Why
doesn’t this make him two people? How does his Incarnation relate to the
Trinity? How could Jesus have hungered (Matthew 4:2) and died (Mark 15:37) when
he was on earth, and yet still be God? Did Jesus give up any of his divine
attributes in the Incarnation? Why is it inaccurate to say that Jesus is a
“part” of God? Is Jesus still human now, and does he still have his human
body?</P>
<H2><STRONG>Jesus has two natures  —  God and man</STRONG></H2>
<P>The first truth we need to understand is that Jesus is one Person who has two
natures: a divine nature and a human nature. In other words, Jesus is both God
and man. We will look at each nature accordingly.</P>
<P><STRONG>Jesus Is God</STRONG></P>
<P>The Bible teaches that Jesus is not merely someone who is a lot like God, or
someone who has a very close walk with God. Rather, Jesus is the Most High God
himself. Titus 2:13 says that as Christians we are “looking for the blessed hope
and the appearing of the glory of <EM>our great God</EM> and Savior, Christ
Jesus.” Upon seeing the resurrected Christ, Thomas cried out, “My Lord and
<EM>my God</EM>!” (John 20:28). Likewise, the book of Hebrews gives us God the
Father’s direct testimony about Christ: “But of the Son he says, ‘Your throne,
<EM>O God</EM>, is forever and ever" and the gospel of John calls Jesus “the
<EM>only begotten God</EM>” (John 1:18).<BR><BR>Another way the Bible teaches
that Jesus is God is by showing that he has all of the attributes of God. He
knows everything (Matthew 16:21; Luke 11:17; John 4:29), is everywhere (Matthew
18:20; 28:20; Acts 18:10), has all power (Matthew 8:26–27; 28:18; John 11:38–44;
Luke 7:14–15; Revelation 1:8), depends on nothing outside of himself for life
(John 1:4; 14:6; 8:58), rules over everything (Matthew 28:18; Revelation 1:5;
19:16;), never began to exist and never will cease to exist (John 1:1; 8:58),
and is our Creator (Colossians 1:16). In other words, everything that God is,
Jesus is. For Jesus is God. <BR><BR><STRONG>Specifically, Jesus Is God the
Son</STRONG></P>
<P>In order to have a more complete grasp of Christ’s incarnation, it is
necessary to have some sort of understanding of the Trinity. The doctrine of the
Trinity states that God is one being, and this one God exists as three distinct
Persons. This truth means, first of all, that we must distinguish each Person of
the Trinity from the other two. The Father is not the Son or the Holy Spirit,
the Son is not the Holy Spirit or the Father, and the Holy Spirit is not the
Father or the Son. They are each a distinct center of consciousness, a distinct
form of personal existence. Yet, they all share the exact same divine
nature/essence. Thus, the <EM>three persons</EM> are <EM>one being</EM>. The
divine being/essence is not something that is divided between the Persons with
each Person receiving one-third. Rather, the divine being is fully and equally
possessed by all three Persons such that all three Persons are each fully and
equally God. <BR><BR> How does the fact that God is three Persons in one Being
relate to the incarnation? To answer, let’s consider another question: Which
Person became incarnate in Jesus Christ? All three? Or just one? Which one? The
biblical answer is that <EM>only God the Son became incarnate</EM>. The Father
did not become incarnate in Jesus and neither did the Holy Spirit. Thus,
<EM>Jesus is God, but he is not the Father or the Holy Spirit</EM>. Jesus is God
the Son.<BR><BR> The truth that it is only God the Son who became incarnate is
taught, for example, in John 1:14, which says “And <EM>the Word became
flesh</EM> and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only
begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.” In context, the Word is God
the Son (cf. 1:1, 18, and 3:16). Thus, it wasn’t the Father or the Holy Spirit
who became man, but God the Son. <BR><BR> Likewise, at Jesus’s baptism we see
the Father affirming, “You are my beloved Son, in You I am well pleased” (Luke
3:22). He did not say, “You are me, and with myself I am well pleased.” Rather,
the Father affirmed that Jesus is the Son, <EM>his</EM> Son, and that Jesus is
well pleasing to him. In this same verse we also see that the Holy Spirit is
distinct from the Father and the Son, for the Holy Spirit is present in “bodily
form like a dove.”<BR><BR>Why is it important to know that Jesus is specifically
God the Son? For one thing, if we do not understand this truth, we will be
mistaken about the very identity of our Savior. Further, it greatly affects how
we relate to our triune God. If we think that Jesus is the Father or the Holy
Spirit, we will be greatly misguided and confused in our prayers. Last, it is
considered heresy to believe that the Father became incarnate in Jesus.
<BR><BR><STRONG>Jesus Is Man</STRONG></P>
<P>It should be obvious that if Jesus is God, then he has always been God. There
was never a time when he became God, for God is eternal. But <EM>Jesus has not
always been man</EM>. The fantastic miracle is that this eternal God <EM>became
man</EM> through the incarnation approximately 2,000 years ago. That’s what the
Incarnation was: God the Son becoming man. And that is the great event we
celebrate at Christmas.<BR><BR> But what exactly do we mean when we say that God
the Son became man? We certainly do not mean that he turned into a man in the
sense that he stopped being God and started being man. Jesus did not give up
<EM>any</EM> of his divinity in the incarnation, as is evident from the verses
we saw earlier. Rather, as one early theologian put it, “Remaining what he was,
he became what he was not.” Christ “was not now God <EM>minus</EM> some elements
of his deity, but God <EM>plus</EM> all that he had made his own by taking
manhood to himself.”<A name="ftnref3" title="ftnref3"></A><SUP><A href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man#ftn3">3</A></SUP>
Thus, Jesus did not give up any of his divine attributes at the incarnation. He
remained in full possession of all of them. For if he were to ever give up any
of his divine attributes, he would cease being God.<BR><BR> The truth of Jesus’s
humanity is just as important to hold to as the truth of his deity. The apostle
John teaches how denying that Jesus is man is of the spirit of the antichrist (1
John 4:2; 2 John 7). Jesus’s humanity is displayed in the fact that he was born
as a baby from a human mother (Luke 2:7; Galatians 4:4), that he became weary
(John 4:6), thirsty (John 19:28), and hungry (Matthew 4:2), and that he
experienced the full range of human emotions such as marvel (Matthew 8:10) and
sorrow (John 11:35). He lived on earth just as we do. <BR><BR><STRONG>Jesus Is a
Sinless Man</STRONG></P>
<P>It is also essential to know that Christ does not have a sinful nature, and
neither did he ever commit sin — even though he was tempted in all ways (Hebrews
4:15). Thus, Jesus is fully and perfectly man and has also experienced the full
range of human experience. We have a Savior who can truly identify with us
because he is man and who can also truly help us in temptation because he has
never sinned. That is an awesome truth to cherish and sets Christianity apart
from all other religions.</P>
<H2><STRONG>Each Nature Is Full and Complete </STRONG></H2>
<P>Having seen the biblical basis that Jesus is both God and man, the second
truth that we must recognize is that each of Christ’s natures is full and
complete. In other words, Jesus is fully God and fully man. Another helpful way
to say it is that Jesus is 100% God and 100% man.<BR><BR><STRONG>Jesus Is Fully
God</STRONG></P>
<P>We saw earlier that each Person of the Trinity is fully God. The three
Persons of the Trinity are not each one-third of God, but are each all of God.
Thus, Jesus is fully God since he is God the Son incarnate. Which means that
<EM>everything</EM> that is essential to being God is true of Jesus. Jesus is
not part of God or one-third of God. Rather, he is fully God. “For in him
<EM>all the fullness</EM> of Deity dwells in bodily form” (Colossians
2:9).<BR><BR><STRONG>Jesus Is Fully Man</STRONG></P>
<P>It is also important to recognize that when we say that Jesus is man, we do
not simply mean that he is partially man. We mean that he is <EM>fully</EM>
human — everything that belongs to the essence of true humanity is true of him.
He is just as truly human as the rest of us.<BR><BR> The fact that Jesus is
truly and fully human is clear from the fact that he has a human body (Luke
24:39), a human mind (Luke 2:52), and a human soul (Matthew 26:38). Jesus does
not just look like a man. He does not just have some aspects of what is
essential for true humanity but not others. Rather, he possess full
humanity.<BR><BR> It is helpful to be aware of the false views concerning
Christ. For if we have a grasp of what we are not to believe, it will give us a
fuller picture of what we are to believe. One of the false views that was
rejected at the Council of Chalcedon taught that “the one person of Christ had a
human body but not a human mind or spirit, and that the mind and spirit of
Christ were from the divine nature of the Son of God.”<A name="ftnref4" title="ftnref4"></A><SUP><A
href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man#ftn4">4</A></SUP>
Since this view did not believe that Jesus has a human mind and spirit, it in
effect denied that Christ is fully and truly man. Rather, it presented Christ as
a sort of half-man who has a human body, but whose human mind and soul were
replaced by the divine nature.</P>
<P>But as we saw earlier, Jesus is just as fully human as the rest of us, for
just as he has all of the essential elements of the Godhead, he has all the
essential elements of human nature: a human body, a human soul, a human mind, a
human will, and human emotions. His human mind was not replaced by his divine
mind. Rather, he has both a human and divine mind. For these reasons, it can be
misleading to use phrases such as “Jesus is God in a body” or “Jesus is God with
skin on.”<BR><BR><STRONG>Jesus Will Be Fully God <EM>and Fully Man</EM>
Forever</STRONG></P>
<P>For most people it is obvious that Jesus will be God forever. But for some
reason it escapes a lot of us that Jesus will also be <EM>man</EM> forever. He
is still man <EM>right now as you read this</EM> and will be forever. The Bible
is clear that Jesus rose physically from the dead in the same body that had died
(Luke 24:39) and then ascended into heaven as a man in his physical body (Acts
1:9; Luke 24:50–51). It would make no sense for him to have done this if he was
simply going to ditch his body and stop being man when he arrived in
heaven.<BR><BR> That Christ continued being man with a physical body after his
ascension is confirmed by the fact that when he returns, it will be as a man in
his body. He will return physically. Philippians 3:21 says that at his second
coming, Christ “will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with
the <EM>body of his glory</EM>.” This verse is clear that Jesus still has his
body. It is a glorified body, which Paul calls, “the body of his glory.” And
when Christ returns, he will still have it because this verse says that he will
transform our bodies to be like his. Both Jesus and all Christians will then
continue living together in their bodies forever, because the resurrection body
cannot die (1 Corinthians 15:42) since it is eternal (2 Corinthians
5:1).<BR><BR> Why did Jesus become man, and why will he be man forever? The book
of Hebrews says it was so that Christ could be an adequate Savior who has all
that we need. “He had to be made like his brothers in all things, that he might
become a <EM>merciful and faithful high priest</EM> in things pertaining to God,
to <EM>make propitiation</EM> for the sins of the people” (2:17).</P>
<P>First, notice that Jesus became man so that he could die for our sins. He had
to be human in order to pay the penalty for humans. Second, this verse says that
because Jesus is human like us, he is able to be a merciful and faithful High
Priest. His humanity enables him to more fully sympathize with us and identify
with us. I cannot help but believe that it is very destructive to our comfort
and faith to not know that Jesus is still man and in his body. For if he is not
still man in heaven, how could we have comfort knowing that he can fully
sympathize with us? He can sympathize and be a faithful high priest and know
what we are going through not just because he was once on earth as a man, but
because he continues forever as that same man.</P>
<H2><STRONG>Each Nature Remains Distinct</STRONG></H2>
<P>The truths of Christ’s two natures — his full manhood and full Godhood — are
pretty well understood and known by Christians. But for a right understanding of
the incarnation we must go even further. We must understand that the two natures
of Christ remain distinct and retain their own properties. What does this truth
mean? Two things: (1) They do not alter one another’s essential properties and
(2) neither do they mix together into a mysterious third kind of nature.</P>
<P>First, it would be wrong to think that Christ’s two natures mix together to
form a third kind of nature. This is one of the heresies that the early church
had to fight. This heresy taught that</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the human nature of Christ was taken up and absorbed into the
  divine nature, so that both natures were changed somewhat and a <EM>third kind
  of nature</EM> resulted. An analogy to [this] can be seen if we put a drop of
  ink in a glass of water: the mixture resulting is neither pure ink nor pure
  water, but some kind of third substance, a mixture of the two in which both
  the ink and the water are changed. Similarly, [this view] taught that Jesus
  was a mixture of divine and human elements in which both were somewhat
  modified to form one new nature.<A name="ftnref5" title="ftnref5"></A><SUP><A
  href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man#ftn5">5</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>
<P>This view is unbiblical because it demolishes both Christ’s deity and
humanity. For if Christ’s two natures mixed together, then he is no longer truly
and fully God and truly and fully man, but is some entirely different kind of
being that resulted from a mixture of the two natures.<BR><BR> Second, even if
we acknowledge that the natures do not mix together into a third kind of nature,
it would also be wrong to think that the two natures changed one another. For
example, it would be wrong to conclude that Jesus’s human nature became divine
in some ways or that his divine nature became human in some ways. Rather, each
nature remains distinct and thereby retains its own individual properties and
<EM>does not change</EM>.</P>
<P>As the Council of Chalcedon stated it, “. . . the distinction of natures
being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each
nature being preserved . . .”<A name="ftnref6" title="ftnref6"></A><SUP><A href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man#ftn6">6</A></SUP>
Jesus’s human nature is human, and human only. His divine nature is divine, and
divine only. For example, Jesus’s human nature did not become all-knowing
through its union with God the Son, and neither did his divine nature become
ignorant of anything. If any of the natures underwent a change in its essential
nature, then Christ is no longer truly and fully human, or truly and fully
divine.</P>
<H2><STRONG>Christ Is Only One Person</STRONG></H2>
<P>What we have seen so far about the deity and humanity of Christ shows us that
<EM>Christ has two natures</EM> — a divine nature and a human nature — that each
nature is full and complete, that they remain distinct and do not mix together
to form a third kind of nature, and that Christ will be both God and man
forever.</P>
<P>But if Christ has two natures, does this mean that he is also two people? No,
it does not. Christ remains one person. There is only one Christ. The church has
historically stated this truth in this way: Christ has <EM>two natures</EM>
united in <EM>one person</EM> forever.</P>
<P>At this point we find another heretical view to beware of. This view, while
acknowledging that Jesus is fully God and fully man, denies that he is only one
Person. According to this view, there are two separate persons in Christ as well
as two natures. In contrast to this, the Bible is very clear that, while Jesus
has two natures, he is only one Person. In other words, what this means is that
there are not two Jesus Christ’s. In spite of the fact that he has a duality of
natures, he is not two Christ’s, but one. While remaining distinct, the two
natures are united together in such a way so as to be one Person. <BR><BR> To
put it simply, there is a certain sense in which Christ is <EM>two</EM>, and a
different sense in which Christ is <EM>one</EM>. He is <EM>two</EM> in that he
has two real, full natures — one divine and one human. He is <EM>one</EM> in
that, while remaining distinct, these two natures exist together in such a way
so that they constitute “one thing.” In other words, the two natures are both
<EM>the same Jesus</EM>, and thus are one Person. As the Chalcedonean Creed
says, Christ is “to be acknowledged in two natures . . . concurring in one
Person and one Subsistence, not parted or divided into two persons, but one and
the same Son, and only begotten God, the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ . . .”</P>
<P><STRONG>Evidence That Christ Is Only One Person</STRONG></P>
<P>We will look at three pieces of the biblical teaching that, while Christ has
two distinct and unchanged natures, he nonetheless remains one Person.
<BR><BR><EM><STRONG>1. Both natures are represented in Scripture as constituting
“one thing;” that is, as united in one Person.</STRONG></EM> We read in John
1:14, “And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.” Here we see the two
natures: the Word (his deity) and flesh (humanity). Yet we also see that there
is one Person, for we read that the Word <EM>became</EM> flesh. “Became”
requires that we acknowledge a unity of the two natures such that they are one
thing — that is, one Person. For in what sense could John write that the word
<EM>became</EM> flesh if the natures do not constitute one Person? It surely
cannot mean “turned into” flesh, for that is against the scriptural teaching on
the distinctness of the natures. Additional Scriptures relating to this line of
evidence include Romans 8:3, Galatians 4:4, 1 Timothy 3:16, Hebrews 2:11–14, and
1 John 4:2–3. <BR><EM><BR><STRONG>2. Jesus never speaks of himself as “We,” but
always as “I.”</STRONG> <BR></EM> <BR><EM><STRONG>3.  Many passages refer to
both natures of Christ, but it is clear that only one person is
intended.</STRONG></EM> It is impossible to read the following passages, which
clearly affirm Christ’s two natures, and conclude that Christ is two Persons:
“For what the law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did:
sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin,
he condemned sin in the flesh . . .” (Romans 8:3). “But when the fulness of time
came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law . . .”
(Galatians 4:4). “. . . who, although he existed in the form of God, did not
regard equality with God a thing to be grasped [that is, exploited to his own
advantage], but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, and being made in
the likeness of men” (Philippians 2:6–7). <BR><BR> Having seen that Christ is
two natures in one person, and having also seen some of what is involved in this
reality, we will now examine one of the major implications which should help us
to complete the picture and our understanding. <BR><BR><STRONG>Implication:
Things that are true of one nature but not the other are nonetheless true of the
<EM>Person</EM> of  Christ.</STRONG></P>
<P>As we saw earlier, the fact that Christ is two natures means that there are
things that are true of his human nature that are not true of his divine nature.
And there are things true of his divine nature that are not true of his human
nature. For example, his human nature hungered, but his divine nature could
never be hungry. So when Christ hungered on earth, it was his humanity that
hungered, not his divine nature.</P>
<P>But the truth that we are now in a position to understand is that by virtue
of the union of the natures in one Person, the things that are true of and done
by only one of Christ’s natures are nonetheless true of and done by the
<EM>Person</EM> of Christ. In other words, things which only one nature does can
be considered to have been done by Christ himself. Likewise, things that are
true of one nature but not the other are true of the Person of Christ as a
whole. What this means, in simple terms, is that if there is something that only
one of Christ’s natures did, he can still say, “<EM>I</EM> did it.”</P>
<P>We have many instances in Scripture which demonstrate this reality. For
example, Jesus says in John 8:58, “. . . before Abraham was, I am.” Now,
Christ’s human nature did not exist before Abraham. It is Christ’s divine nature
that eternally exists before Abraham. But since Christ is one Person, he could
say that before Abraham was, <EM>he</EM> is.</P>
<P>Another example is Christ’s death. God cannot die. We should never speak of
Christ’s death as the death of God. But humans can die, and Jesus’s human nature
did die. Thus, even though Jesus’s divine nature did not die, we can still say
that <EM>the Person of Christ experienced death</EM> because of the union of the
two natures in the one Person of Christ. Because of this truth, Grudem says, “by
virtue of union with Jesus’s human nature, his divine nature somehow tasted
something of what it was like to go through death. The <EM>person</EM> of Christ
experienced death.”<A name="ftnref7" title="ftnref7"></A><SUP><A href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man#ftn7">7</A></SUP></P>
<P>Have you ever wondered how Jesus could say that he did not know the day or
hour of his return (Matthew 24:36) even though he is omniscient (John 21:17)? If
Jesus is God, why didn’t he know the day of his return? This dilemma is solved
by our understanding that Christ is one Person with two natures. The answer is
that in regards to his human nature, Jesus does not have all knowledge. Thus, in
his human nature he really did not know the day or hour of his return. But in
his divine nature, he does have all knowledge and thus in his divine nature he
did know when he would return.</P>
<P>Here comes the most fascinating part: Since the two natures are united in one
Person, the fact that Christ’s human nature didn’t know when he would return
means that the Person of Christ did <EM>not</EM> know when he would return.
Thus, Jesus the Person could truly say, “But of that day and hour no one knows,
not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone” (Matthew
24:36). At the same time, by virtue of his divine nature, we can also say that
the Person of Christ <EM>did</EM> know when he would return. Knowledge and
ignorance of the time of his return are both true of the Christ, but in
different ways. In his human nature, the Person of Christ was ignorant of when
he would return. In his divine nature, the Person of Christ did know when he
would return. Thus, Christ himself both knew and did not know when he would
return.</P>
<H2><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></H2>
<P>We have seen the biblical evidence for the fact that Christ is God the Son,
that he has both a divine and human nature, that each nature is full and
complete, that each nature remains distinct, that Christ is nonetheless one
Person, and that things which are true of one nature are true of the Person.</P>
<P>The relevance of these truths to us should go without saying. For they go to
the very heart of who Christ is. Knowing these truths will greatly affect the
way you view Christ and will make the gospel accounts of his life come more
alive. As such, this understanding will deepen our devotion to Christ.</P>
<P>Second, having this richer understanding of the incarnation of God the Son
should greatly enhance our worship. We will have great marvel and gladness at
the fact that the eternal Person of God the Son became man forever. Our
recognition of Christ’s worth will be heightened. And our faith in him will be
strengthened by having this deeper understanding of who he is.</P>
<P>The union of Christ’s deity and humanity in one Person makes it such that we
have all that we need in the same Savior. How glorious! Because Jesus is God, he
is all-powerful and he cannot be defeated. Because he is God, he is the only
adequate Savior. Because he is God, believers are safe and can never perish; we
have security. Because he is God, we can have confidence that he will empower us
for the task that he commands us for. And because he is God, all people will be
accountable to him when he returns to judge the world.</P>
<P>Because Jesus is man, he has experienced the same things that we do. Because
he is man, he can identify with us more intimately. Because he is man, he can
come to our aid as our sympathetic High Priest when we reach the limits of our
human weaknesses. Because he is man, we can relate to him — he is not far off
and uninvolved. Because he is man, we cannot complain that God does not know
what we are going through. He experienced it firsthand.</P>
<P>Finally, we need to be ready to defend the truth of Jesus’s deity, Jesus’s
humanity, and their joining inconfusedly in one Person. Therefore, consider
committing to memory many of the verses which teach that Jesus is both God and
man, and be able to explain the relationship between Christ’s two natures to
others.</P>
<P>May we look forward to the day when we see him face to face. Until then, may
the joyful hope of this day inspire in us a great diligence in serving and
worshiping him.</P>
