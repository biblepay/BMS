<b>Repent of Your Sins</b>

<br><p><p>

When you dedicate your life to Jesus, Jesus makes you a new man or woman.  Your old life literally dies.  I view this as if a seed was planted, by the Holy Spirit, in your chest, and with proper care and watering, this tiny seed will grow into a full mustard tree.  When this happens, your life will be full of the fruits of the spirit.
