<h2>Problems with the Theology Taught by Jehovah Witnesses in contrast to the literal Abrahamic bible</h2>

<small>by Rob Phillips, and other various sources.  <br>The Watch Tower is the official magazine of the Jehovah Witnesses which helps express their beliefs.</small>

<ul>
<li><h4>The Trinity.</h4> The Watch Tower says Jesus is a created being and the “holy spirit” is an impersonal force. “The obvious conclusion is, therefore, that Satan is the originator of the trinity doctrine”.
<br>

<br>The Bible tells us there is one true and living God who exists as three distinct, co-equal, co-eternal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

<br>

<li><h4>The deity of Christ. </h4>
The Watch Tower teaches that Jesus was created “just as angels were spirit beings created by God…. The fact is that Jesus is not God and never claimed to be” (Should You Believe in the Trinity?).
<br><br>


The Bible, however, records at least seven ways Jesus reveals His deity: He calls Himself the “I AM;” claims equality with the Father; receives worship; forgives sins; teaches with divine authority; affirms the apostles’ statements of His deity; and fulfills the attributes unique to God.



<li><h4>The personhood and deity of the Holy Spirit. </h4>

Jehovah’s Witnesses liken the “holy spirit” to electricity – an impersonal, powerful, unseen force under the sovereign control of Jehovah.
<br><br>

The Bible, however, clearly establishes the deity of the Holy Spirit as the third person of the triune Godhead. The Bible uses the words “Holy Spirit” and “God” interchangeably. Jesus calls the Spirit “another Counselor,” with the Greek word allos meaning “another of the same kind.” As Jesus is a divine person who comforts His followers, so is the Spirit.







<li><h4>Christ’s sacrificial and substitutionary death on the cross. </h4>
The Watch Tower says that Jesus died (on a STAKE) as a “ransom sacrifice” to buy back what Adam lost: the right to perfect life on earth, but was not resurrected physically as the Christian bible says.

<br><br>
Further, Jesus died on an upright stake or post. The cross, JWs believe, is a pagan symbol embraced later by wayward Christianity.

<br><br>


The Bible, however, is clear that Jesus died on a cross, or stauros in Greek. 

More important, Jesus’ death on the cross paid our sin debt and purchased our salvation so that everlasting life is received by grace through faith in Jesus.

<br>
Test the spirits John 1:4:  Isnt it interesting that every spirit that is not of God claims God did not physically die for us, it was a spiritual event?  This is true in Isalm also-- the Quran states something very similar: That Jesus was a prophet and that he did not physically die or suffer at the cross but was Raised up by God and that he survived the crucifixion.
(God will not let this blasphemy pass the test of John 1:4 by any religion who does not believe what Jesus did for us).








<li><h4>Christ’s bodily resurrection. </h4>

The Watch Tower teaches that Jesus was “raised from the grave, <b>not a human creature, but a spirit</b>” (Let God Be True).
<br><br>

The Bible, in contrast, reveals that Jesus predicted His bodily resurrection, and then fulfilled it on the third day after His crucifixion.
<br>
Let us be crystal clear on this point:  The bible clearly states Jesus was buried (he was put in the tomb with grave clothes) and after three days he was PHYSICALLY resurrected (THE BODY WAS MISSING).  
<br>
They do not believe in the physical crucifixion; they believe Jesus died on a stake, and was not physically resurrected, they say he was Spiritually resurrected and the spirit came out of the tomb.  Christians know that Jesus body was physically resurrected (it was missing).





<li><h4>Christ’s physical and visible return. </h4>

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe Jesus began his “invisible presence” on earth in 1914. “Since no earthly men have ever seen the Father … neither will they see the glorified Son” (Let God Be True).

<br><br>

The Bible, however, tells us Jesus is in heaven today, seated at the Father’s right hand. He will return one day physically, visibly, and personally.  No man knows the DAY OR HOUR!  (TEST THE SPIRITS!).





<li><h4>Salvation is always by grace through faith. </h4>

JWs believe salvation is earned through a combination of faith plus good works – specifically, taking in knowledge of Jehovah and Jesus; obeying God’s laws; belonging to and serving with God’s true organization (The Watch Tower); and being loyal to God’s organization.
<br>
<br>

The Bible tells us that Christ’s death at Calvary paid our sin debt and purchased our salvation so that everlasting life is received by grace through faith in Jesus.

<br>
They believe that faith + works get you to heaven (this is why they keep track and go door to door), while Christians know that Faith + Grace = Salvation, and we are saved by the finished work of the cross.





<li><h4>Consciousness of the soul after death AND NOT ETERNAL LIFE!  AND PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE IMMORTAL SOULS!?</h4>

The Watch Tower teaches “soul sleep” – that is, the soul rests in the grave with the body until the resurrection. JWs deny that people possess immortal souls.
<br><br>


The Bible tells us there is conscious existence in the intermediate state between physical death and resurrection. Samuel, Moses, Elijah, the rich man and Lazarus all are depicted as alive and conscious following their departures from earth.



<li><h4>People in hell Die through annihilation and do not suffer forever</h4>

 Jehovah’s Witnesses teach the annihilation of the wicked in hell.

<br><br>

However, the Bible says hell is a place of <b>everlasting</b> conscious existence, where unbelievers are forever separated from God.



<li><h4>Heaven as the destination for all believers.</h4>
 The Watch Tower teaches two classes of redeemed people: the “little flock” of 144,000 in heaven, and the “other sheep” who, if worthy, abide forever on a restored earth.
<br><br>


The Bible teaches that all believers have God’s promise of a home in heaven. We go there instantly upon physical death. After our resurrection, we return with Christ to earth, which He purges of sin and makes new.




<li><h4>They have their own BIBLE.  </h4>

Its called the New World Translation.  It was altered:  47 verses were DELETED, 237 references to God or Lord changed to JEHOVAH (even verses that might have been for JESUS).

<br>
The 6 translators in 1961 did not know Greek, who wrote the NWT.  How do you write a bible without knowing the source language?  
<br>

Verses about hell omitted; verses about Jesus omitted.



<br><br>
 They also modified scriptures, stripping Jesus of his dietyhood.  They changed John 1:1 to say "The word was <b>a</b> god".

<br>

Unfortunately I believe this is blasphemy, and since that is the unforgivable sin, I recommend any JW repents immediately.
<br>
Example: Mt 28:17 And when they saw him they worshiped him; However the NWT JW Bible has changed this (about Jesus) to the word for 'Acknowledged him in respect'.
<br>








<li><h4> Do Jehovah's Witnesses believe in the Trinity?</h4>

The answer to this is no. It is one of the more major ways in which Jehovah's Witnesses differ from various Christian denominations. 
<br><br>
Jehovah's Witnesses refer to the fact that the Bible never explicitly mentions the term "trinity." They claim this "doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies."



<li><h4>What do Jehovah's Witnesses teach about Jesus?</h4>
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus is not equal with God. They teach that Jesus was created by God and not coexistent wth Him. 
<br><br>
(We know in Christianity however, Jesus said he was 'I am' before Abraham, and if you know God you know the Father).
<br><br>
JW.org explains, "[W]e take Jesus at his word when he said: 'The Father is greater than I am.' (John 14:28) So we do not worship Jesus, as we do not believe that he is Almighty God."  
<br><br>Therefore they take one verse out of context and ignore
the plethora of verses that make Jesus equal to God (and even CHANGE them in point 11 above, which is blasphemy).
<br>
They believe Jesus is the archangel Michael, but Michael is very distinct in Revelations, your Prince of your land (Israel) will stand up and fight against the Devil and throw him out (of second heaven) to Earth.  
We know from Hebrews 2:5 it is said about Jesus: But he was made a little lower than the Angels, and everything was put everything under his feet.
If he is Michael then how can he come to Earth a little lower than the chief Angel, its obvious Jesus and Michael are distinct individuals.  Nevertheless, Michael doesnt come down to earth until Mid Tribulation! 



<li><h4>Do the JW Celebrate Easter?</h4>
<br>
JW does not celebrate Easter or Christmas, which imho, is disrespectful to Jesus because they are not celebrating his death on the cross or his birth!
