<h2>Jesus in the Psalms</h2>

<br>
<br>


Most of the Psalms, written by King David, sometime around 960 BC, foretell of Jesus Christ, a thousand years before his birth in the Flesh.
Some Psalms even talk about Jesus being present at the foundation of the World with Father God.

<br>

Jesus said about the Psalms:
<br>
 
 "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me."
(Luke 24:44).

<br>

<br>

 
<h3>Psalm 8:4 </h3>
<br>
 What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of man that You visit him?  
<br>
5 For You have made him a little lower than the angels, And You have crowned him with glory and honor.  
<br>6 You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet,  
<br>7 All sheep and oxen -- Even the beasts of the field.
<br>

<br>

 

<br>
 

Hebrews 2:5 
<br>
<br>
For He has not put the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels.  
<br>6 But one testified in a certain place, saying: "What is man that You are mindful of him, Or the son of man that You take care of him?  7 You have made him a little lower than the angels; 
<br>You have crowned him with glory and honor, And set him over the works of Your hands.  8 You have put all things in subjection under his feet." 
<br>For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But now we do not yet see all things put under him.  
<br>9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.
<br>

<br>


<h3>Psalm 2:1</h3>
Prophecies about how Jesus would be King of the Kingdom and no one could stop it from happening.
<br>
 

Psalm 2:1 Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing?  2 The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying,  
3 "Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us."

<br>


The nations that rage are talking about gentile nations and it also refers to the kings and rulers of Jesus’ day that plotted against Him.

<br>

 
<h3>Psalm 2:4  </h3>
<br>He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The LORD shall hold them in derision.  
<br>5 Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, And distress them in His deep displeasure:  
<br>6 "Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion."  
<br>7 "I will declare the decree: The LORD has said to Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.
<br>
<br>

 

No matter how strong a nation may be or how strategic they are, they cannot change God’s plan. David cannot believe that a nation can convince themselves that they could stand up against God, 
which is why David pictures God as laughing at their futile plans.

<br>

<br>
 
<h3>Psalm 2:8</h3>
 Ask of Me, and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth for Your possession.  
<br>
9 You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.' "  
<br>10 Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth.  
<br>11 Serve the LORD with fear, And rejoice with trembling.  
<br>12 Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, And you perish in the way, When His wrath is kindled but a little. 
<br>Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.
<br>

<br>

 

The Psalms also talk a lot about Jesus’ reign as king and high priest and His Deity. This information can be seen in Psalms 45, 72, 110 and 132. 

<br>
 

<h3>Psalm 110:1 (A Psalm of David) </h3>

The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."  
<br>
2 The LORD shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. 
<br>Rule in the midst of Your enemies!  
<br>3 Your people shall be volunteers In the day of Your power; 
<br>In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, You have the dew of Your youth.  
<br>4 The LORD has sworn And will not relent, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek."  
<br>5 The Lord is at Your right hand; He shall execute kings in the day of His wrath.  
<br>6 He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill the places with dead bodies, He shall execute the heads of many countries.  
<br>7 He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; Therefore He shall lift up the head.
<br>

<br>

 

Psalm 45:6 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom.

<br>

Hebrews 1:8  
But to the Son He says: "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.
<br>
 
The Psalm also speaks of the end of time when Jesus judge the nations as spoken of in Matthew 25 and He will continue His reign as it is now until the last enemy is destroyed, which is death. 
Again, this confirmed in the N.T. Paul speaking of Jesus wrote:
 <br>

1 Corinthians 15:24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power.  
25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.  26 The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.

<br> 


When Jesus made His entry into Jerusalem on a donkey shortly before His death, we learn that Ps. 118: 26 is applied to Jesus in:
<br>
Matthew 21:9 Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: "Hosanna to the Son of David! 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!' Hosanna in the highest!"
<br>

 

David also writes about how Judas would betray Jesus in:
<br>
 
<h3>Psalm 41:9 </h3>
Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, Who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.

<br>

<br> 


John 13:18 "I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.'


<br>
We also learn from:

<br> 

Psalm 118:22 The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.
<br>

We can know this was talking about Jesus and how the Jews rejected Him, and His church. This can be confirmed in:

<br> 

Acts 4:10 "let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, 
by Him this man stands here before you whole.  11 "This is the 'stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.

<br>
 

<h3>Psalm 22</h3>

This is one the most quoted Psalm in NT and it deals the suffering and circumstances that Jesus went through on the cross. 
I recommend that you listen carefully to these first 21 verses and envision in your mind Jesus hanging on the cross and how these verses apply to Him at that moment.
<br>
 

Psalm 22:1 My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Why are You so far from helping Me, And from the words of My groaning?  
<br>
2 O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not hear; And in the night season, and am not silent.  3 But You are holy, Enthroned in the praises of Israel.  
<br>4 Our fathers trusted in You; They trusted, and You delivered them.  5 They cried to You, and were delivered; They trusted in You, and were not ashamed.  6 But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised by the people.  
<br>
7 All those who see Me ridicule Me; They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,  8 "He trusted in the LORD, let Him rescue Him; Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!"  
<br>
9 But You are He who took Me out of the womb; You made Me trust while on My mother's breasts.  10 I was cast upon You from birth. From My mother's womb You have been My God.  
<br>
11 Be not far from Me, For trouble is near; For there is none to help.  12 Many bulls have surrounded Me; Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled Me.  
<br>
13 They gape at Me with their mouths, Like a raging and roaring lion.  14 I am poured out like water, And all My bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax; It has melted within Me.  
<br>
15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And My tongue clings to My jaws; You have brought Me to the dust of death.  16 For dogs have surrounded Me; The congregation of the wicked has enclosed Me. They pierced My hands and My feet;  
<br>
17 I can count all My bones. They look and stare at Me.  18 They divide My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots.  19 But You, O LORD, do not be far from Me; O My Strength, hasten to help Me!  
<br>20 Deliver Me from the sword, My precious life from the power of the dog.  21 Save Me from the lion's mouth And from the horns of the wild oxen! You have answered Me.

<br>


<br> 

Matthew 27:39 And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads  40 and saying, "You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! 
<br>
If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."  
<br>
41 Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said,  42 "He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.  
<br>
43 "He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.' "  44 Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.  
<br>
45 Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.  46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, 
<br>
"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"  
<br>
47 Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, "This Man is calling for Elijah!"  48 Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.
<br>

<br>          

"Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be," that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: "They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots." Therefore the soldiers did these things.
<br> 

John 19:33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.  34 But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.  
<br>
35 And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe.  36 For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, "Not one of His bones shall be broken."  
<br>
37 And again another Scripture says, "They shall look on Him whom they pierced."
<br>


We can only begin to imagine what Jesus went through physically and mentally as He was given an illegal trial by the Jews, eas beaten, spit on, and scourged and then crucified. As if this wasn’t bad enough, 
<br>
He then had to experience the worst thing He had ever experienced and that was temporary separation from God.
<br>
<br>
 

We also learn about Jesus’ resurrection in:

 
<br>
<h3>
Psalm 16:10 </h3>
For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
<br>

 

Acts 2:25 "For David says concerning Him: 'I foresaw the LORD always before my face, For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.  
<br>
26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad; Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.  
<br>
27 For You will not leave my soul in Hades, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.  
<br>
28 You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of joy in Your presence.'  
<br>
29  "Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.  
<br>
30 "Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,  
<br>
31 "he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.  32 "This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.
<br>


 

<h3>Psalm 68:18  </h3>
You have ascended on high, You have led captivity captive; You have received gifts among men, Even from the rebellious, That the LORD God might dwell there.
<br>

Ephesians 4:8 Therefore He says: "When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, And gave gifts to men."  9 (Now this, "He ascended" -- what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of 
the earth?  10 He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)
<br>
Personally, I find it interesting to see how much the Psalms talk about Jesus’ life, death, resurrection, and ascension.
