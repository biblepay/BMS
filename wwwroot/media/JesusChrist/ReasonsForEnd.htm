<ul><h3><b>Signs pointing to us being in the end times:</b>

<li> Matthew 25: Wars and rumors of wars, massive earthquakes and natural disasters
<li>
 In the end Many Shall Travel To and Fro and Information will Increase (Danel 12:4)
<li>
 In the last generation Israel will be dwelling securely and restored to their land
<li>
 The restoration of Israel as a nation (1967)
<li>
 Obamas 8 year reign, reigned in with the #666 on the 3 digit the day after election (and 7779 on 4 digit)
<li>
 Trump as a respite after a taste of the AntiChrist
<li>
 Hundreds of rapture videos pouring in on youtube, and these people shaking and warning us God said I AM COMING NOW
<li>
 News of the 3rd temple ready to be built
<li>
 News of the peace agreement rumored to come soon between Israel and the Palestinians
<li>
 Major prophets now agree we are in the end times (Sundar, Bakker, Cioccolanti, etc)
<li>
 Gods timeclock: 6000 years of history, then 1000 years in the Millenial Kingdom,
the Star of Bethlehem every 2K years, Adam (1), Abraham (2), Christ (3), Jesus when 27
is 2000 years from the last star of bethlehem.  That makes a perfect 6000 year history (2027).  Adam was born 6000 years ago, Abraham 4000, Christ 2000, and now we are only 7 years away from Jesus' 2000 year anniversary of starting his ministry.
<li>
 In the last days kids will be : lovers of themselves (facebook), lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to parents, ungrateful unholy etc.
<li>
(2 Timothy 3:2) - Evil is now good and good evil
<li>
 The cups of wrath in Revelation seem to be being tested by angels- major fishkills and
dead animals, hints of drought and farming problems (famine), and hints of pestilence
<li>
Daniel 9 - We know that the 69 weeks fulfilled Jesus coming then an indeterminate
amount of time passes before the 70th week, but, we also know after Israel is restored
as a nation, the 70th week is at the door, and obviously the first part of this is fulfilled
<li>
 Isaiah 17 about to be fulfilled - Damascus will be destroyed and cease to be a city (one of the few unfulfilled prophecies) and is almost happening right now
<li>
 It appears Ezekiel 38 is being "prepared", take a look at the countries involved - they are
forming alliances right now (Turkey, Iran and Russia)
<li>
 The signs - the sun turned to darknesss, the moon to blood, 6 times in this current 2016-2024 era (counting the last swath of the eclipse)
<li>
 The revelation 12 sign passed; that to me kicked off the end times (happened Sep 2018) from an astrological perspective
<li>
 The Star of Bethlehem passed over Israel during the end of Obamas presidency (signaling the end of this 2000 year dispensation - the end of the church age - the end of Grace)
Remember it took about 4 years for Jesus to be born after the star passed over Bethlehem (7BC) that means this sign isnt over until 2020
<li>
 The Gentiles were grafted in after Israel was scattered, and Messiah was born - the Age of Grace is clear and started when Jesus started his church in Acts; this clearly shows
me a new dispensation started in 27AD - and these ages have a historical length of 2000 years (Adam, Abraham, Jesus) - all 2000 year ages.
<li>
 Technologically the 666 beast system is possible now or soon (IE cashless society, nwo here now)
<li>
 1 Timothy 4:1 - A prosperity gospel - In the latter times some shall depart fro the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
<li>
 Hosea 4:3 The land shall mourn - the fishes of sea shall be taken away
<li>
 1 Thessalonians 5:3 - for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction (Waiting for peace agreement)
 <li>Merton's Law, Moore's law, the rise of AI, the threat of WW3, all point to a singularity, a lethal increase in technology, that collapses under its own weight, meaning the end of the human race may coincide with the rapture.
 In more concrete terms, I think this means that as of 2019, in just 12 years, our technology doubles 12 more times (with technology becoming half priced 12 times), an unusually powerful situation giving a massive amount of energy
 and information to a society that becomes more and more perverse and capable of destroying itself.  Each time technology doubles, human clones and hybrids become more refined, AI increases, the networks double in speed
 and usefulness, and smaller countries become more empowered.  EMP could happen by 2020.  Hypersonic nukes by 2024 (Russia).  Jet cars (2028) for everyone.  Robots for everyone (2030) like the Jetsons.
 Imagine where the Deep State would be by 2030?  FEMA CAMPS, mass Christian Arrests, NWO flourishing, can you see a Christian future past 2036?  Coincidentally, another set of blood moons occur in the 2036 era.
</ul>

<ul><h3><b>Things we are waiting for that must happen to usher in the end:
<li>
 2 Thessalonians 2:3 - That day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition

(This could happen when Israel starts looking for their Messiah, right after 3rd temple built, and right after peace agreement signed)
<li>
 Matthew 24:9 - They shall deliver you up to be afflicted and kill you - you will be hated for my names sake
<br>(We are expected to be persecuted as Christians, maybe the US will be rounded into Fema camps)
<li>
 Matthew 24:12 - And because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold
<br>(This could happen in the beginning of the trib)
<li>
Matthew 24:14 - And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto the nations; then the end shall come
(Impo, this means God will pour out his spirit on us and create a Real church, one with healing like the Last Reformation does - Torben Sondergaard, and not a prosperity gospel,
we shall go out in his name and save souls, and the gospel will be preached around the world, the true Gospel)
<li>
 The abomonition of desolation shall stand in the most holy place
<br>(After 3rd temple built, Antichrist is already alive, steps in and warms up on the scene)
<li>
 The Rapture
<br>(I believe in a pre-trib, so this could actually happen First, before the Antichrist is revealed, and usher in all the bad)
<li>
 Isaiah 17- Damascus shall cease to be a city
<br>(This is on the cusp)
<li>
 Ezekiel 38 - They shall surround Israel, as a cloud, and trample her unwalled villages as they dwell in Peace and Safety
<br>(Alliances being formed right now)
