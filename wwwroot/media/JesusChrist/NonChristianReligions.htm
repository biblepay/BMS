<li>Atheists:
	<p>


	In our humble opinion, Atheists end their lives without a God, which will <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLimoqZUWgw>lead them to Satan in the end.

<li>
Buddhists and false Gods:
<p>
Buddhists, Idolaters, and those worshiping false Gods (such as oceans or trees or money).

<p>
<p>Story of a Buddhist who <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivG8ejbG0GE>went to hell in his NDE:</a>
<p><p>What many do not realize is the Gods they worship: Statues, money, Buddha, they are related to the entities in hell - those entities did not choose Christ and are in hell and they try to captivate and
 take control of your lives by moving you away from Christ.


<li>Muslims:

<p>

Muslims believe: They worship the God of Abraham, Ishmael, and Jacob, and God had no Son, but Jesus was a good man.
<p>
Jesus said to this Muslim: <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGBp_ft6UqY>I am the God of the Christians: I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  He is God's son.</a>

Don't be fooled into living a full life while serving the wrong God.
