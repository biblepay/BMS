The prophet Elijah urged the people of ancient Israel to turn from sin and to return to the true God. His message is just as important for us today.

	<p>About a hundred years had passed in ancient Israel since the time of King David, who had set a high standard of faithfulness and integrity in serving the one true
	<a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/god" target="_blank">God</a>. Now a wicked king named Ahab did more to provoke God to anger than
	all the kings of Israel who had come before him (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 16:33
	<br>33 And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 16:33</a>). The date was around 870 B.C.</p>

<p>The apostasy during Ahab&rsquo;s reign was the result of many years of corrupt kings and increasing evil, until wickedness filled the land. A majority of the people had yielded to Satan and his demons through their worship of the Canaanite gods Baal and Ashtoreth. Still, God had declared that there were 7,000 persons in Israel who had not worshipped Baal during that very wicked time (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 19:18<br>18 Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 19:18</a>).</p>

<p>Earlier, God had sent warnings and waited patiently for His people to separate themselves from the pagan influences that surrounded them and to return to true worship (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 14:6-16<br>6 And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, &ldquo;Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another person? For I have been sent to you with bad news.<br />
7 Go, tell Jeroboam, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God of Israel: &ldquo;Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Israel,<br />
8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and yet you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes;<br />
9 but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back<br />
10 therefore behold! I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel, bond and free; I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away refuse until it is all gone.<br />
11 The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field; for the Lord has spoken!&rdquo;&rsquo;<br />
12 Arise therefore, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.<br />
13 And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something good toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.<br />
14 &ldquo;Moreover the Lord will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam; this is the day. What? Even now!<br />
15 For the Lord will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their wooden images, provoking the Lord to anger.<br />
16 And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and who made Israel sin.&rdquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 14:6-16</a>). Now God was going to bring a severe judgment on the nation to stir them to action.</p>

<p>God explains, &ldquo;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing, unless He reveals His secret to His servants the <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/prophecy/prophets/prophets-of-the-bible" target="_blank">prophets</a>&rdquo; (Amos 3:7). To announce the punishment and warn the nation to change its ways, God sent a messenger, Elijah the prophet.</p>

<h3>Elijah&rsquo;s first miracle</h3>

<p>Elijah is first mentioned in Scripture when he declares to King Ahab that a severe drought would begin immediately to test Israel and its leadership. &ldquo;Elijah &hellip; said to Ahab, &lsquo;As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except at my word&rsquo;&rdquo; (1 Kings 17:1).</p>

<p>Withholding rain for 3&frac12; years was the first miracle God did through the prophet. This would bring severe famine throughout the kingdom. The purpose of this punishment was to bring the nation to <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/change/repentance/what-is-repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a> of its idolatry. Although unpleasant at the time, Elijah likely understood the potentially good effects of such punishment if Israel would repent of its sins. God always determines the magnitude and duration of punishment that He brings; and in this case, He moved Elijah to pray for an end of the rain and later for it to begin again.</p>

<h3>Elijah the man</h3>

<p>God appointed this man of the desert regions to go before kings, bringing the message of warning and repentance. Elijah the Tishbite, of Gilead, was a human being just like any of us&mdash;a man of similar hopes and dreams, weaknesses and shortcomings, but also a man of deep faith in God. Elijah was a bold, direct-to-the-point prophet of God. By speaking the prophecies of God, he made fierce enemies, but his enemies could not overpower him.</p>

<p>The apostle James would later speak of Elijah&rsquo;s faith saying, &ldquo;Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit&rdquo; (James 5:17-18).</p>

<h3>Elijah chosen by God</h3>

<p>Like many of the prophets, Elijah did not seek to be God&rsquo;s messenger. Instead, God chose him for the job. Once called, Elijah did not hesitate to take on his mission, even though it appeared that his life would be threatened by the wicked king. Elijah set out at once for the capital city of Samaria to deliver the announcement to King Ahab. Then God sent Elijah into hiding as the drought dried up the streams and withered the crops of the nation (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 17:7-15<br>7 And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.<br />
8 Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying,<br />
9 &ldquo;Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. See, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.&rdquo;<br />
10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, indeed a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, &ldquo;Please bring me a little water in a cup, that I may drink.&rdquo;<br />
11 And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, &ldquo;Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&rdquo;<br />
12 So she said, &ldquo;As the Lord your God lives, I do not have bread, only a handful of flour in a bin, and a little oil in a jar; and see, I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.&rdquo;<br />
13 And Elijah said to her, &ldquo;Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son.<br />
14 For thus says the Lord God of Israel: &lsquo;The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
15 So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate for many days.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 17:7-15</a>; <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 18:1<br>1 And it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, &ldquo;Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the earth.&rdquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 18:1</a>).</p>

<p>The prophets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal" target="_blank">Baal</a> were humiliated when they couldn&rsquo;t invoke their pagan god to end the drought and bring the needed rain upon the land. King Ahab and his officials were furious with Elijah, thinking that he was the cause of so much suffering in Israel; and they hunted for Elijah far into foreign lands (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 18:10<br>10 As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, &lsquo;He is not here,&rsquo; he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 18:10</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, the prophet was directed by God to appear before King Ahab again. &ldquo;Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, &lsquo;Is that you, O troubler of Israel?&rsquo; And he answered, &lsquo;I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father&rsquo;s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals&rsquo;&rdquo; (1 Kings 18:17-19).</p>

<h3>Showdown at Mount Carmel</h3>

<p>Elijah&rsquo;s greatest public miracle involved a contest with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah on Mount Carmel. Elijah invited these false prophets and all Israel to a demonstration to show that Baal had no power at all against the God of Israel. The outcome would demonstrate who served the true God (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 18:19-40<br>19 Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;<br />
20 So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel.<br />
21 And Elijah came to all the people, and said, &ldquo;How long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.&rdquo; But the people answered him not a word.<br />
22 Then Elijah said to the people, &ldquo;I alone am left a prophet of the Lord; but Baal&rsquo;s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.<br />
23 Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it.<br />
24 Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.&rdquo;So all the people answered and said, &ldquo;It is well spoken.&rdquo;<br />
25 Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, &ldquo;Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.&rdquo;<br />
26 So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, &ldquo;O Baal, hear us!&rdquo; But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made.<br />
27 And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, &ldquo;Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.&rdquo;<br />
28 So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.<br />
29 And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.<br />
30 Then Elijah said to all the people, &ldquo;Come near to me.&rdquo; So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.<br />
31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, &ldquo;Israel shall be your name.&rdquo;<br />
32 Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.<br />
33 And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, &ldquo;Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.&rdquo;<br />
34 Then he said, &ldquo;Do it a second time,&rdquo; and they did it a second time; and he said, &ldquo;Do it a third time,&rdquo; and they did it a third time. 35 So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.<br />
36 And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, &ldquo;Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.<br />
37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that You are the Lord God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again.&rdquo;<br />
38 Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.<br />
39 Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, &ldquo;The Lord, He is God! The Lord, He is God!&rdquo;<br />
40 And Elijah said to them, &ldquo;Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!&rdquo; So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>).</p>

<p>To show God&rsquo;s power, Elijah told the large crowd, &ldquo;I alone am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal&rsquo;s prophets are four hundred and fifty men&rdquo; (1 Kings 18:22). Elijah continued, &ldquo;How long will you falter between two opinions? If the LORD is <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/god/who-is-god" target="_blank">God</a>, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him&rdquo; (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 18:21<br>21 And Elijah came to all the people, and said, &ldquo;How long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.&rdquo; But the people answered him not a word.<br />
22 Then Elijah said to the people, &ldquo;I alone am left a prophet of the Lord; but Baal&rsquo;s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 18:21</a>). God would give convincing proof that day that He was Israel&rsquo;s only true God.</p>

<p>So the contest commenced. Throughout the day, the false prophets called on their god to send down fire and consume an animal sacrifice&mdash;but to no avail.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Elijah called on Israel&rsquo;s God to send fire to swallow up the sacrifice prepared for Him. God responded to Elijah&rsquo;s prayer. In a moment thousands witnessed the fire from heaven consume the carcass, all the water in the trench and all the wet wood, burning up even the stones!</p>

<p>Elijah exposed the deception of the false prophets of Baal and at last the hearts of the Israelites were convinced that only Israel&rsquo;s God could do this miracle. Elijah then ordered that the false prophets be executed (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 18:36-40<br>36 And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, &ldquo;Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.<br />
37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that You are the Lord God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again.&rdquo;<br />
38 Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.<br />
39 Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, &ldquo;The Lord, He is God! The Lord, He is God!&rdquo;<br />
40 And Elijah said to them, &ldquo;Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!&rdquo; So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 18:36-40</a>). Then God&rsquo;s Spirit moved Elijah to pray that it would rain; and the rains came, ending the terrible drought (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 18:42-45<br>42 So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees,<br />
43 and said to his servant, &ldquo;Go up now, look toward the sea.&rdquo; so he went up and looked, and said, &ldquo;There is nothing.&rdquo; And seven times he said, &ldquo;Go again.&rdquo;<br />
44 Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, &ldquo;There is a cloud, as small as a man&rsquo;s hand, rising out of the sea!&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Go up, say to Ahab, &lsquo;Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
45 Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 18:42-45</a>; <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="James 5:18<br>18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">James 5:18</a>).</p>

<h3>God&rsquo;s prophets are hated</h3>

<p>When the false prophets of Baal were dead, Elijah came under a death threat by Jezebel, the wicked wife of King Ahab. As Israel&rsquo;s queen, she brought the worship of her god Baal into the nation, influencing King Ahab to worship Baal and set up idols in Israel (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 16:31<br>31 And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal and worshiped him.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 16:31</a>; <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 21:25-26<br>25 But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the Lord, because Jezebel his wife stirred him up.<br />
26 And he behaved very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 21:25-26</a>). God&rsquo;s prophets who bring messages of warning are often hated and accused of actually being the cause of such suffering. Jezebel and the false prophets of Baal hated Elijah, and they spared no effort to catch him.</p>

<p>In a moment of human weakness Elijah was deeply discouraged, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before God reassured Elijah and sent him back again to face King Ahab. Elijah was to deliver the message that Ahab and Jezebel would both die a humiliating death because of all the wicked deeds they refused to repent of (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 21:20-24<br>20 So Ahab said to Elijah, &ldquo;Have you found me, O my enemy?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord:<br />
21 &lsquo;Behold, I will bring calamity on you. I will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel, both bond and free.<br />
22 I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and made Israel sin.&rsquo;<br />
23 And concerning Jezebel the Lord also spoke, saying, &lsquo;The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.&rsquo;<br />
24 The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field.&rdquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 21:20-24</a>).</p>

<h3>History is being repeated</h3>

<p>The world today still has its Ahabs and Jezebels. The present age also has its idolatry, though it is more subtle than that of Elijah&rsquo;s day.</p>

<p>The shrines of pagan worship may not be as visible in a basically Christian-professing society, and there may be very few carved images that people actually worship, yet millions are following after the gods of this world. Today&rsquo;s idols can be riches, fame, pleasure and the pleasant-sounding fables that occupy the hearts and minds of many who are unwilling and disinterested in learning about God.</p>

<h3>An end-time Elijah</h3>

<p>Sometimes prophecies can have multiple fulfillments.&nbsp;Bible prophecy seems to point to another Elijah-like work that will arise at the end of this age before the coming time of God&rsquo;s great <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation/wrath-of-god" target="_blank">wrath</a> upon the earth. The prophet <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/bible/holy-bible/old-testament/the-prophets/minor-prophets/malachi" target="_blank">Malachi</a> declared, &ldquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD&rdquo; (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="Malachi 4:5-6<br>5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.<br />
6 And he will turn The hearts of the fathers to the children, And the hearts of the children to their fathers, Lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">Malachi 4:5-6</a>).</p>

<p>Similar to the way John the Baptist came &ldquo;in the spirit and power of Elijah&rdquo; (Luke 1:17), this end-time fulfillment will feature a commission much like the one of the first Elijah.&nbsp;Scripture indicates that an Elijah-like message to repent and obey God will be preached by the Church of God (Matthew 24:14; 28:19-20).</p>

<h3>What God wants today</h3>

<p>We can learn about the message of the final Elijah by studying the mission of John the Baptist. Gabriel brought a message from God that a prophet was coming to announce that Jesus was the Christ, the long-awaited Messiah<em>.</em> John the Baptist was that prophet, and Jesus declared that John was an Elijah-like figure, in addition to one who would come later (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="Matthew 11:14<br>14 And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">Matthew 11:14</a>; <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="Matthew 17:12<br>12 But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer at their hands.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">Matthew 17:12</a>).</p>

<p>An angel declared of John&rsquo;s mission: &ldquo;And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. He will also go before Him [Jesus] in the spirit and power of Elijah, &lsquo;to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children&rsquo; and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord&rdquo; (Luke 1:16-17).</p>

<p>The messages of Elijah and the other <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/bible/holy-bible/old-testament/the-prophets" target="_blank">prophets</a> of the Old Testament played an important role in the establishment of the New Testament Church. Paul told Church members of the first century that they were part of the household of God that had &ldquo;been built on the foundation of the apostles and <em>prophets, </em>Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone&rdquo; (Ephesians 2:20, emphasis added).</p>

<p>At the time of the end, just before the great and dreadful day of God&rsquo;s wrath, the world will again be given the same message that was preached by Elijah the prophet. As noted, <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="Malachi 4:5-6<br>5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.<br />
6 And he will turn The hearts of the fathers to the children, And the hearts of the children to their fathers, Lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">Malachi 4:5-6</a> seems to indicate that an Elijah-like work will be done before Christ&rsquo;s return. Furthermore, as the world enters this time of judgment, two witnesses will be given power to stop rainfall for 3&frac12; years&mdash;this time over all nations.</p>

<p>Christ says, &ldquo;And I will give power to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. &hellip; These have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire&rdquo; (Revelation 11:3, 6).</p>

<p>God will take no pleasure in sending these judgments, and disobedient nations will need to be reminded of God&rsquo;s purpose for them: &ldquo;&lsquo;Do I have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?&rsquo; says the Lord GOD, &lsquo;and not that he should turn from his ways and live?&rsquo;&rdquo; (Ezekiel 18:23; see also <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="Ezekiel 33:11<br>11 Say to them: &lsquo;As I live,&rsquo; says the Lord God, &lsquo;I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?&rsquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).</p>

<p>The message of the two witnesses will again be like that of Elijah. It will be a call to repentance and of preparing a people for Christ&rsquo;s second coming. Be sure to read more on the role of these two prophets in the article &ldquo;<a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation/two-witnesses" target="_blank">Two Witnesses</a>.&rdquo; Also read our article &ldquo;<a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/change/repentance/what-is-repentance" target="_blank">What Is Repentance</a>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elijah is considered one of the most important prophets of the Old Testament. He faithfully carried out God&rsquo;s mission in the face of danger and hardship. His was a singular voice of &ldquo;one crying in the wilderness&rdquo; to rebuke sin in the land and to expose the false prophets and false religions of his day.</p>

<p>In Elijah&rsquo;s day a revival of true worship was begun. Be sure to read the article &ldquo;<a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/prophecy/prophets/prophets-of-the-bible/elisha-the-prophet" target="_blank">Elisha the Prophet</a>&rdquo; to see how God continued the course He had for His people through the next prophet sent to Israel. Elijah&rsquo;s whole life was devoted to the work of restoring true worship in Israel. His admonition that God&rsquo;s people faithfully serve Him with their whole hearts remains important for us today.</p>
