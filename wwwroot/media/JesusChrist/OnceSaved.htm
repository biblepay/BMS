<h1>21 Signs you are a Lukewarm Christian</h1>
<p>


<p>
<h3>	Friends, we find real scriptural evidence that Once Saved Always Saved is False.</h3>

	<p>On a side note, the bible never actually contradicts itself.  We as humans misinterpret things.
In our case here, it is more logical to follow what the bible does say about the subject, leading us to believe that we can lose our salvation if we are not Good Christians:
<p>
<h3>
<ul>
<li>  The Bible says that maintaining faith requires great effort, a “hard fight.” (Jude 3, 5).
 Early Christians who had already accepted Christ were told: “Keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”—Philippians 2:12.
 <li>
   The Bible warns against serious sins that will keep a person from entering God’s Kingdom in 1 Corinthians:  (1 Corinthians 6:9-11)   Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God’s Kingdom?
      Do not be misled.    Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters,  adulterers,  men who submit to homosexual acts,
       men who practice homosexuality,
       thieves, greedy people,
        drunkards,  revilers,  and extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
        <li>
        The Bible warns against other serious sins in (Galatians 5:19-21) that may keep us from entering Heaven:
            Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct (disrespecting authority), idolatry,
            spiritism, hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects, envy, drunkenness, wild parties and things like these.
            I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
           <li>
           	   If salvation could not be lost, such warnings would be meaningless. Instead, the Bible shows that someone who has been saved can fall away by returning to a practice of serious sin.
           	   <p>
           	           	   For example, Hebrews 10:26 states: “If we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there
           	           	   is no longer any sacrifice for sins left.” (Hebrews 6:4-6;) (2 Peter 2:20-22)
           	    <li>
           	    Jesus emphasized the importance of maintaining faith by giving an illustration in which he likened himself to a vine and his followers to branches on that vine.
           	    Some of them would at one time demonstrate faith in him by their fruits, or actions, yet would later fail to do so and be “thrown out like a [fruitless] branch,” losing their salvation. (John 15:1-6)
           	    <li>
           	               	    The apostle Paul used a similar illustration, saying that Christians who do not maintain their faith “will be lopped off.” (Romans 11:17-22).
           	   <li>
           	   Christians are commanded to “keep on the watch.” (Matthew 24:42; 25:13).
           	   Those who fall asleep spiritually, whether by practicing “works belonging to darkness” or by not fully performing the works that Jesus commanded, lose their salvation.
           	    (Romans 13:11-13); (Revelation 3:1-3).
           	    <li>
           	    Many scriptures show that those who have been saved must still endure faithfully to the end. (Matthew 24:13; Hebrews 10:36; 12:2, 3; Revelation 2:10)
           	    <li>
           	    First-century Christians expressed joy when they learned that fellow believers were enduring in their faith. (1 Thessalonians 1:2, 3; 3 John 3, 4)
           	    <li>
           	    Does it seem reasonable that the Bible would stress faithful endurance if those who did not endure would be saved anyway?
           	    <li> Only when his death was imminent did the apostle Paul feel that his salvation was assured. (2 Timothy 4:6-8)
           	    <p>Earlier in his life, he recognized that he could still miss out on salvation if he gave in to fleshly desires.
           	    <p>
           	    He wrote: “I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.”—1 Corinthians 9:27; Philippians 3:12-14.

           	    <li>
           	    <p>The unrepetant souls.  Those who commit sins as a Christian and do not repent.
           	    <li>
           	    The unforgiven sins: Those people who hold grudges and do not forgive others risk having Jesus not forgive them for sins.
           	    <li>Pastors, who have been saved, who have blasphemed the Holy Spirit by spreading False Gospel (the unforgivable sin).
           	       These pastors have been seen in hell in NDEs.
           	    <li>Pastors who Have been saved, who have stolen money from the church and have not repented.
           	    <li>NDE list: Those who have seen Christians in Hell.
