<h3>1.  Recognize that Jesus died on the cross for you</h3>


<br><p><p>

    <br>
<p><p>

    In John 3:16, God explains to us that he sent his only begotten son, Jesus Christ to die for us, and that whomever believes in him shall be saved.
    You must believe in this doctrine in your heart.

    <h3>2.  Repent of Your Sins</h3>


    <br>
<p><p>

    <br>
<p><p>

    When you dedicate your life to Jesus, Jesus makes you a new man or woman.  Your old life literally dies.  I view this as if a seed was planted, by the Holy Spirit, in your chest, and with proper care and watering, this tiny seed will grow into a full mustard tree.  When this happens, your life will be full of the fruits of the spirit.

    <br>
    But we must turn from our sin first.  We should renounce bad habits, apologize for them, and promise to turn from them.
<p><p>

    Here is a list of sins that we should repent of, before we read the sinners prayer:

            <h3>3.  Recite the Sinners Prayer</h3>


            <br>
            <br><p><p>

                Becoming a Christian is not merely believing some creed or going to church. It is having Christ Himself take residence in your life and heart.
            <p><p>

                <br>
                Jesus said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door,
                I will come in ..."

                If you would like to have a relationship with Christ, simply pray this prayer and mean it in your heart:
                <br>

            <p><p>


                "Dear Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner. I believe You died for my sins. Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life. I confess You as my personal Lord and Savior.
            <p><p>

                <br>
                Thank You for saving me. Amen."
            <p><p>

            <p><p>

                Congratulations!  Now you are a member of the Kingdom of God!
            <p><p>

                <h3>4.  Network with Christians</h3>
                <br />


                <br>
                Next you should network with like minded individuals (Christians).  You will notice a strange thing, usually after a small period of time:  You can no longer tolerate swearing.  Pesky sins like smoking or drinking have gone out the window.  You have a desire to do good things for others!  What a life!
                <br>
            <p><p>


                Ask the Holy spirit into your life.  Say, Fill me up God, with the Holy Spirit!
                <br>
            <p><p>

                You will become zealous for the Lord.  Start reading the bible.
            <p><p>

                <br>
                Next, learn about how to be baptized in the name of Jesus.
            <p><p>
