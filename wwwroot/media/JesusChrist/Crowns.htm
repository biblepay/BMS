Reserved for those who do not store up treasures on earth.</h3>
<p>
You should not be tempted by greed, coveting, or materialism.

 practicing the exercises of hardship, pursuing the interest of the soul,
  combatting fleshly lusts, combatting the appetite).

3) RIGHTEOUSNESS - (2 Timothy 4:8) - Crown of Righteousness
<p>
Loving and Longing for his coming - trusing him as the Right and Just Judge,
 for THOSE WHO ENDURE DISCOURAGEMENTS, PERSECUTIONS, SUFFERINGS OR DEATH, FOR CHRIST,

You rebuke other false religions: Hinduism, Islam, Roman Catholicism and maintain your faith of Christianity even through persecution.
<p>
Maintaining your loyalty to Jesus & the Christian Religion.

in us. (Romans 8:18)

Spreading the word and Teaching the Word (Feeding the Sheep) may allow you to earn a Crown of Glory.
