<h1>The Gentiles Were Grafted In</h1>
<p>

(Romans 11:11-31)

So I ask, did they [the Jews] stumble in order that they might fall?
<p>
By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles,
 so as to make Israel jealous.

<p>
(Romans 11:12)
  Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!
  <p>
  (Romans 11:13)
  Now I am speaking to you Gentiles.
    Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles,
    I magnify my ministry
    <p>
    (Romans 11:14)
     in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.
     <p>
      For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
       If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
       <p>
       (Romans 11:17)
        But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root
          of the olive tree,
           do not be arrogant toward the branches.
           If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.
           (Romans 11:19)
            Then you will say,
            “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”
             That is true.
             They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith.
             <p>
               So do not become proud, but fear.
                For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
                <p>
                (Romans 11:22)
                Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you,
                <p>
                provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.
                (Romans 11:23)
                 And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
                  For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these,
                  (Romans 11:24)
                  the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.

<p>

<h3>
   The Mystery of Israel's Salvation
   </h3>

  <p>
   Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery,
 brothers:
   a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
  <p>
  (Romans 11:26)
   And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written,
   “The Deliverer will come from Zion,
    he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”;
   (Romans 11:27)
    “and this will be my covenant with them
    when I take away their sins.”
    <p>

  As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election,
   they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
   <p>
   (Romans 11:29)
    For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
    (Romans 11:30)
     For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,
      so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy.

<h1>
PROPHETIC WORD- AN AWAKENING CALL
</h1>
<p>
This prophecy was received by Carla Louis in September 2016 Elul, regarding the Grafting of the Gentiles:
<p>

I SPEAK FORTH THIS WORD UNDER THE INSTRUCTION OF THE MOST HIGH ‘ELOHIM', WHOSE NAME IS YHWH ‘EL OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC & JACOB ‘EL OF YISRA'EL.

<p>

HE has instructed me to speak and to write these WORDS.
<p>

These WORDS are directed to HIS people Israel, NATURAL BORN,
descendants of ALL TWELVE TRIBES scattered in foreign lands
throughout the four corners of the earth.
<p>

I say NATURAL BORN because it is YOU He has specifically told me to address.
Though you are unaware of your true identity & nationality, He will reveal it to you…
<p>

Yet He has already, for you know who you are in your hearts….
YOU ARE THE SEED OF ISRAEL
<p>

Bear in mind- this awakening call is not for a Church, Religious Organization, Denomination or
Movement… but a ‘NATION OF PEOPLE’
<p>

These WORDS will vex, anger and offend many of you who will hear and read them. He has
already warned me of this. Nevertheless, I am instructed to speak FEARLESSLY and BOLDLY
what He has shown me.
<p>

THUS SAYS YHWH ELOHIM
TO THE TWELVE TRIBES OF YISRA’EL SCATTERED ABROAD:
<p>

WAKE UP!!!

<p>
ARISE!!
<p>
FOR IT IS TIME!!
<p>
IT IS TIME YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!
<p>

THOUGH I HAVE CAUSED THE MEMORY OF YOU AS A NATION TO CEASE….

<p>
AND YOUR IDENTITY TO BE BLOTTED OUT AND ERASED FROM MANKIND,
<p>
YET AM I AWAKENING YOU, FOR IT IS TIME!!

<p>
It is time you know and understand who you are… what your forefathers did that caused
your exile in the nations;
<p>

How they disobeyed my laws, statutes and commandments.
How they angered me, sinned against me, defiling themselves and the LAND I gave to
them as an inheritance.
<p>

How they profaned MY NAME
<p>

and worshipped idols made of stone and wood- gods I never showed them.
How they bowed their knees to them, sacrificed their sons to them,
shedding the blood of my innocent ones…
<p>

THEY PROVOKED ME TO ANGER!!!
THEY MOVED ME TO JEALOUSY!!!
<p>

So I removed them from THE LAND of their inheritance… the land of Promise
I scattered them into the nations among the gentiles,
 in the four corners of the earth where YOU dwell.
You got there by ships- you got there by way of the seas
EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH…..
<p>

I have scattered you, as I said I would;
I have cursed you, as I said I would,
because your fathers did not obey my commands.
They chose curses and death over blessings and life.
Neither do you obey!!…..
<p>

It is time you know and understand these things that I have done and…
REPENT!!
Repent for your fathers, repent for yourselves…
Here is MY TESTIMONY against your fathers,
MY WITNESS I have preserved for you…
<p>

A SONG I told my servant Moses to write and teach your fathers.
Though you were in their loins- yet you heard!
A SONG for them, A SONG for you
So that you would know what they did and understand what I have done.
They broke covenant with me, although I was their Rock
<p>

Their Husband
Their Maker
<p>

They moved me to jealousy with their idols……
<p>

So do I move you to jealousy with a people “not a people”
A people I have concealed, yet revealed,
They are hidden and covered over like the moon hides the sun in an eclipse.
<p>

A people whom I have caused to believe are you, though they are not…
as they are of another house, another tent, another nation-
<p>

So as to make you jealous, like your fathers made me jealous.
Therefore have I put them in your place and in your land.
<p>

I have allowed them to dwell in YOUR tents…
YES…. KNOW THAT IT IS I WHO HAS DONE THIS THING, AS I SAID I WOULD…
<p>

To make you jealous, like I told my servant Moses to write in the SONG
So that you would know, so that you would understand.
<p>

Yet will I give to this people, peace and blessings- as I have promised…
though among them are those of the synagogue of satan- whom I will destroy.
<p>

I am provoking you to anger…
 just as your fathers did to me with their vain, empty, foolish idols!
 <p>

I am provoking you with a “foolish people”….
people of the nations…. <b>Gentiles</b>
<p>

For they have angered you and they do anger you…
<p>

Yet have I given them an opportunity to turn to me… to be my people, as you are.
To walk in obedience to my laws, statutes and commandments- because your falling
away has opened the door of Salvation to them.
<p>

But the time has come for your RESTORATION;
For you to return to me- and for me to receive you unto Myself as MY PEOPLE….
<p>

For in your restoration, is the fulness of the EARTH…
the realignment of the COSMOS and the UNIVERSE!!
IT IS LIFE FROM THE DEAD !!!!…
Have you not heard that all creation groans and travails for your manifestation as a
NATION?… as a PEOPLE?
<p>

Do you not know these things?
<p>

IT IS TIME TO COME FORTH OH YISRA’EL!
<p>

IT IS TIME FOR YOUR BIRTH!
<p>

REPENT AND RETURN TO ME,
<p>

RETURN TO MY TORAH, MY INSTRUCTIONS, MY COMMANDMENTS!
<p>

PRAY TOWARDS THE LAND AND THE CITY FROM WHENCE YOU CAME…
<p>

and I would restore unto you all that I have promised
<p>

when I shall bring you back into YOUR OWN LAND
The land of your inheritance which I gave to your fathers.
Then will you know that I have performed what I have spoken…
<p>

Not for your sakes,
but for MY HOLY NAME’S SAKE…
and for the sake of the covenant I made with my servant Abraham.
WAKE UP, REPENT & PREPARE
FOR MY KINGDOM IS NEAR…
